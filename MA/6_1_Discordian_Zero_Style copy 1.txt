text: The Priests of Eris are not heroes but they fight if necessary ... or if it suits their whims.  Some are attracted to it because the focussed training of Martial Arts brings one to better understand one's higher self.  This form is said to have been invented by the first ever Discordian, the whole tree revealed to him in one instant.  

[... fighting by (the) numbers ...  and more flavour ...]

[Neverborn/Yozi are rumored to have their own complementary Style.  Qliphoth, as opposed to Sephiroth.]

[One of the Charms is Enlightening, or makes buying Enlightening Charms cheaper?]

Perhaps uniquely, this style bridges the gap between the Terrestrial and Celestial levels of mastery.  Dragon-Blooded, enlightened mortals and the like may learn most of the Charms of this tree, though they cost an additional 1 mote to activate.  [Daat] is an Enlightening Charm, though it helps only Dragon-Blooded.  Once they have learned that, they need not pay the additional cost to use Charms of this form, and can learn the rest of the Charms in the tree, as well as any other Celestial forms for which they can find teachers.  Enlightened mortals and other kinds of martial artist can never learn the Charms which have [Daat] as a prerequisite, however, and are not further enlightned by learning it.  Celestial Exalts, as well as Abyssals, Infernals and Autochthonians, may learn the whole form.


The character must choose any one kind of non-ranged weapon when she begins to learn this style: that becomes its form weapon for her.  All other non-ranged weapons weapons may also be used with this style, including improvised weapons.  However, they suffer an Accuracy penalty of -2 (to a minimum of -3) and their damage bonus is halved.  When she learns [Daat], the character may choose another non-ranged weapon type to become an additional form weapon.

text: Every journey begins with a first step, be the ground mud, grass or brass.  The martial artist acknowledges her mortal passions, and begins to see that the focus of the form comes not from repressing them, but from mastering them knack of opening them up to inspiration from higher powers.

If the character channels a Virtue on a stunted Martial Arts action which is successful, she may role the same number of Virtue dice again, with each success adding one points of Essence to the reward from the stunt.  Alternatively she may regain half that many points of Willpower, rounded down.  In addition, the character regains one channel of any one Virtue at the end of the scene.  She cannot regain more than one Virtue channel through use of this Charm, regardless of how many times she uses it in a scene.

8:Hod/Majesty/2e-restriction/Severity
Splendour; praise; passing obstacles by submission, not conquering; community; understanding form through language or crafted symbols

The character submits himself to his enemy, adding his Valor in bonus dice to his enemy's attack.  Such intimate contact brings a direct mystical understanding of the strike, which converts up to (Essence + Valor) levels of lethal damage to bashing, or subtracts ([Essence + Valor] ÷ 2) levels of bashing damage (both before soak).

For each point of Essence above 2, he may reflexively apply the same protection to any one ally within (Essence x 5) yards (still using his own Essence and Valor ratings), provided that the ally is attacked by the same enemy, before the end of the enemy's next action.

Translates spiritual concepts into actions which unite us with God; moon; sexual organs; engine-room of Creation.

For the remainder of the scene, the character may add one to his Essence rating in all calculations based on it (not only Martial Arts actions).  This does not allow him to access new Charms, nor to access facets of Charm effects which require a certain minumum Essence.  For instance, it does not allow an Essence 2 character to extend the benefits of [Hod] or [Netzah] to other characters, but it does allow an Essence 3 character to extend them to /two/ allies.

7:Netzah/Victory/2e-giving/Mercy
Winning through endurance/confidence; patience to follow passions; tactic-level group leadership & motivation

The Priestess of Eris invokes this Charm to supplement a Aim action, converting up to (the higher of [Essence or Temperance]) bonus dice to successes on the subsequent attack (if any).

For each point of Essence above 2, she may reflexively add the bonus dice (not as successes) from her Aim action to the next attack by any one ally within (Essence x 5) yards, provided that attack is on the same target and occurs before the character's next action.  These dice count towards that ally's limit on dice added by Charms for that attack.

5:Gevurah/Severity/1e
Strength; judgement; power; concelament; withholding goodness from those who would misuse it; destroying the unwanted; overpowering.

This Charm lays a Compulsion on all who have Joined Battle against the character in the current scene, to stay at least (Essence x Conviction) yards away from the character, and to move outside that range if they are currently within it.  The effect costs one Willpower to resist, which gains the character a point of Hodge.  (The character cannot gain more than one point of Hodge from a single activation of this Charm, no matter how many enemies resist.)  Opponents within the radius who do not resist experience this Compulsion physically, as Knockback sufficient to move them just outside the range.  The Compulsion does not prevent opponents from using ranged attackings from outside the radius of effect.

Those within the range who were not subject to the Compulsion, including the character, may roll their Conviction to regain Willpower as if they had enjoyed a night's sleep.
