text: The Priests of Eris are not heroes but they fight if necessary ... or if it suits their whims.  Some are attracted to it because the focussed training of Martial Arts brings one to better understand one's higher self.  This form is said to have been invented by the first ever Discordian, the whole tree revealed to him in one instant.  

[... fighting by (the) numbers ...  and more flavour ...]

[Neverborn/Yozi are rumored to have their own complementary Style.  Qliphoth, as opposed to Sephiroth.]

[One of the Charms is Enlightening, or makes buying Enlightening Charms cheaper?]

Perhaps uniquely, this style bridges the gap between the Terrestrial and Celestial levels of mastery.  Dragon-Blooded, enlightened mortals and the like may learn most of the Charms of this tree, though they cost an additional 1 mote to activate.  [Daat] is an Enlightening Charm, though it helps only Dragon-Blooded.  Once they have learned that, they need not pay the additional cost to use Charms of this form, and can learn the rest of the Charms in the tree, as well as any other Celestial forms for which they can find teachers.  Enlightened mortals and other kinds of martial artist can never learn the Charms which have [Daat] as a prerequisite, however, and are not further enlightned by learning it.  Celestial Exalts, as well as Abyssals, Infernals and Autochthonians, may learn the whole form.


The character must choose any one kind of non-ranged weapon when she begins to learn this style: that becomes its form weapon for her.  All other non-ranged weapons weapons may also be used with this style, including improvised weapons.  However, they suffer an Accuracy penalty of -2 (to a minimum of -3) and their damage bonus is halved.  When she learns [Daat], the character may choose another non-ranged weapon type to become an additional form weapon.

text: Every journey begins with a first step, be the ground mud, grass or brass.  The martial artist acknowledges her mortal passions, and begins to see that the focus of the form comes not from repressing them, but from mastering them knack of opening them up to inspiration from higher powers.

If the character channels a Virtue on a stunted Martial Arts action which is successful, she may role the same number of Virtue dice again, with each success adding one points of Essence to the reward from the stunt.  Alternatively she may regain half that many points of Willpower, rounded down.  In addition, the character regains one channel of any one Virtue at the end of the scene.  She cannot regain more than one Virtue channel through use of this Charm, regardless of how many times she uses it in a scene.

Splendour; praise; passing obstacles by submission, not conquering; community; understanding form through language or crafted symbols

The Anchorite gathers his strength, from his own mortal body and from the Essence which flows into him, preparing to pass judgement on his enemy.  Onlookers will see no glowing sparks around him, but his mien takes on a transcendent might and righteousness, which is obvious to all.

The Priest of Eris invokes this Charm to supplement a Aim action, converting up to (the higher of [Essence or Temperance]) bonus dice to successes on the subsequent attack (if any).

For each point of Essence above 2, she may reflexively add the bonus dice (not as successes) from her Aim action to the next attack by any one ally within (Essence x 5) yards, provided that attack is on the same target and occurs before the character's next action.  These dice count towards that ally's limit on dice added by Charms for that attack.

For the remainder of the scene, the character may add one to his Essence rating in all calculations based on it (not only Martial Arts actions).  This does not allow him to access new Charms, nor to access facets of Charm effects which require a certain minumum Essence.  For instance, it does not allow an Essence 2 character to extend the benefits of [Hod] or [Netzah] to other characters, but it does allow an Essence 3 character to extend them to /two/ allies.

Winning through endurance/confidence; patience to follow passions; tactic-level group leadership & motivation

To strike down your enemy is a kindness, for surely he is in the wrong, and must learn this.

The Law-man supplements his attack with this Charm, giving it the Knockback keyword.  For the purposes of the Knockback check, he adds his Valor in automatic successes to its damage, and adds (Valor ÷ 2), rounded up, to the difficulty of the target's roll.

If the target is knocked back, the attack does no damage.  Furthermore, for each point of Essence above 2 which the character possesses, he may use his victory as inspiration and reflexively allow any one ally within (Essence x 5) yards to channel Valor on their next attack, without it counting towards the per-story limit on Virtue channeling.  These allies must still spend Willpower to channel Valor in this way.

5:Gevurah/Severity/1e
Strength; judgement; power; concelament; withholding goodness from those who would misuse it; destroying the unwanted; overpowering.

Lesser fighters focus on defeating their enemies; those who grow in understanding see that one may win by simply ignoring those who are unworthy opponents.

This Charm lays a Compulsion on all who have Joined Battle against the character in the current scene, to stay at least (Essence x Conviction) yards away from the character, and to move outside that range if they are currently within it.  The effect costs one Willpower to resist, which gains the character a point of Hodge.  (The character cannot gain more than one point of Hodge from a single activation of this Charm, no matter how many enemies resist.)  Opponents within the radius who do not resist experience this Compulsion physically, as if a successful Knockback had landed them just outside the range.  The Compulsion does not prevent opponents from using ranged attackings from outside the radius of effect.

The effect ends prematurely, for an individual target, if the character subsequently attacks that target.  Anyone within the range who was not subject to the Compulsion (either because they were not a target or because they immediately resisted it) is bolstered by the perception that they are among the worthy.  At the end of the effect, they may roll their Conviction to regain Willpower as if they had enjoyed a night's sleep.  This opportunity is lost to them if they attack any compelled targets before the effect ends; it is lost to all if the character attacks in this manner.

6:Tiferet/Mercy/1e
Spirituality; balance; integration; miracles; compassion; healing; sacrifice made by Divine to become mortal.

Mortals must struggle their way through life, earning their keep; yet at times unlooked-for, a higher source may empower them, out of recognition of their character and struggle.  Enlightenment, apotheosis and exaltation are powerful examples of this principle, but applies on a smaller scale also.

The martial artist adopts a meditative pose, symbolic of the connection from the highest power to the lowest, from Chaos to Order, yet remains ready to strike in an instant.  When she adopts this form, the character brings raw Essence and constructed reality into balance within herself.

While this form is active, the character adds the highest of her Virtue ratings to her DVs and MDVs, and half that rating to any Martial Arts attack which is unarmed or uses form weapons.  In addition, a successful 2-die stunt will heal a single level of bashing damage, or convert a single level of lethal to bashing; and a successful three-die stunt will heal a single level of lethal, or convert a single aggravated level to lethal.  The character may forgo the normal stunt bonus to double this healing.

Loving kindness with no cause; love of Divine in all things; proactive, initiates.

The brave of heart find joy in combat, but the bright of heart seek only to bring joy and peace to others; to them, combat and conflict are true Anathema.

When this Charm is activated, a glow of colorless Essence gathers around the Ignorant Child, then washes out around him.  This glow heals one level of bashing damage per mote spent, or converts one level of lethal to bashing per 2 motes spent, up to a maximum number lef leves equal to the character's (Compassion).  This benefit applies to all beings within (Essence + Compassion) yards, regardless of whether they are allies, enemies or bystanders.

Processed wisdom; deductive reasoning; engine (not fuel); understanding awakens joy

In due course a wise man must harness the raw creative energy seen in [Hokhmah] to tease out its potential, and working through its possibilities.

With this Charm active, the martial artist sees the consequences of his own and others' actions.  Any unexpected attacks against him are no longer unexpected.  The penalty from any coordinated attacks against him is reduced by his Essence.  The character gains an automatic counterattack against each attack on him, though he suffers flurry penalties in counterattacking flurries.  When counterattacking, he may target and damage dematerialized beings as if they were materialized, and any external penalties due to Stealth effects employed by that attacker are reduced by his Essence.

If the character already has [Hokhmah] active, this Charm may be activated without paying the Willpower cost.

Only characters who have access to Celestial martial arts can learn this Charm.

*:Da'at/Union/i
Assimilated intellect; union with ideas awakens emotions; creation as gateway from self-aware souls, to world of forms

This Charm gives the character a clear awareness of the ratings for Virtues, Willpower and Essence, for each being in her line of sight, up to (Essence x Willpower) yards.  Any penalties to observing the location targets due to Stealth, invisibility or partial cover are reduced by the character's (Essence ÷ 2), as their true natures shine out.  Immaterial beings are locatable as if they were materialized, though only as a nebulous shape embodying these traits.  In all cases, the true appearance of such hidden beings remains unknown, unless revealed by other means.

Furthermore, on any successful attack, the character may reflexively spend 2 motes in step 10 to attempt to temporarily reduce one of these traits.  Bashing damage may be used to reduce any one of the Virtues (by 1 dot); lethal may do the same, or reduce the target's mote pool (by [Essence] motes); and aggravated may alternatively reduce temporary Willpower (by 1 dot).  Immaterial targets may also be subject to this effect on a successful attack, which ignores their immaterial state, though they suffer no physical damage or other contact effects unless by some other means.  The targeted traits cannot be reduced past 0.  Any dots or motes drained are added to the character's own traits, though they cannot surpass the normal limits, and these bonuses fade at the end of the scene.

Merely learning this Charm has benefits in itself.  Any practitioner of this style may choose an additional non-ranged form weapon when first she learns it.  Dragon-Blooded who learn this Charm gain access to Celestial martial arts, including the rest of this style.

3:Hokhmah/Wisdom/i
Selflessness; first unbounded flash of idea, before it takes form; insight; perceiving essence of sth; fuel (not engine)

Opening herself up to raw, pre-conscious creative insight, the martial artist's actions spring from nowhere, from the primal energy of Chaos.  With this Charm active, all of the characters attacks for the rest of the scene become unexpected.

In addition, any attack which causes damage also has the chance of afflicting a temporary Wyld mutation, chosen by the storyteller, as a Shaping effect.  The character makes a contested roll of ([Essence + Willpower] ÷ 2) against the target.  If the character wins, the target suffers a mutation; if she botches, she suffers one herself.  Bashing damage inflicts a pox or deficiency, lethal an affliction or debility, and aggravated a blight or deformity.

If the target (or the character) has already suffered a mutation due to this Charm in the current scene, the new mutation replaces the previous one.  If the target uses magic to resist this Shaping effect, the character gains a point of Hodge.  The mutation fades at the end of the scene.

[TODO: Not sure what this should do against raksha, since I don't know anything about their combat system.]

If the character already has [Binah] active, this Charm may be activated without paying the Willpower cost.

Only characters who have access to Celestial martial arts can learn this Charm.
