text: The Priests of Eris are not heroes but they fight if necessary ... or if it suits their whims.  Some are attracted to it because the focussed training of Martial Arts brings one to better understand one's higher self.  This form is said to have been invented by the first ever Discordian, the whole tree revealed to him in one instant.  

[... fighting by (the) numbers ...  and more flavour ...]

[Neverborn/Yozi are rumored to have their own complementary Style.  Qliphoth, as opposed to Sephiroth.]

[One of the Charms is Enlightening, or makes buying Enlightening Charms cheaper?]

Perhaps uniquely, this style bridges the gap between the Terrestrial and Celestial levels of mastery.  Dragon-Blooded, enlightened mortals and the like may learn most of the Charms of this tree, though they cost an additional 1 mote to activate.  [Daat] is an Enlightening Charm, though it helps only Dragon-Blooded.  Once they have learned that, they need not pay the additional cost to use Charms of this form, and can learn the rest of the Charms in the tree, as well as any other Celestial forms for which they can find teachers.  Enlightened mortals and other kinds of martial artist can never learn the Charms which have [Daat] as a prerequisite, however, and are not further enlightned by learning it.  Celestial Exalts, as well as Abyssals, Infernals and Autochthonians, may learn the whole form.


The character must choose any one kind of non-ranged weapon when she begins to learn this style: that becomes its form weapon for her.  All other non-ranged weapons weapons may also be used with this style, including improvised weapons.  However, they suffer an Accuracy penalty of -2 (to a minimum of -3) and their damage bonus is halved.  When she learns [Daat], the character may choose another non-ranged weapon type to become an additional form weapon.
