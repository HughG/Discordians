Presence Charm to give absence (concealment)?

Some Charm to regain SO by submitting to UMI - could be too easy to twink, though.

Sorcery to change difficulty of Shaping in an area, long term - poss tied to Intimacies etc.

----------------

Lore? Charm to be able to see UMI, like Sorcerer's Sight.

Lore:

Follow-on to Holo Mem Modus to give the character explicit knowledge of things *not* recorded or commonly known in an area, such that it could be written down. Penalty or +diff if something is actively hidden or secret, by mundane or magical means.

Another follow-on related to Echoes which let's the character know things that would have been commonly known about the place in the time/society of an Echo.

Illusion to cause people to add/change/remove a belief about a certain fact?

Training Charms. Temporary Specialty?

Essence-tweaking Charms. Maybe something to extend Recumbent Destiny, Essence-hiding, or some info/identity loss, to others?

Something to hide self from reality? Sounds more like (anti-)Investigation, though.
