This repository contains the source for the book *The Manual of Exalted
Power--Discordians*, which is an extension of the *Exalted* 2nd edition game
line produced by White Wolf.

In order to build it, you will need to add the *protocol23* tools under the
'src' folder, and set up some machine-local configuration.
* Clone <https://github.com/HughG/protocol23> to "src/protocol23".
* Create a file "SConsLocal/Config.py" to set up paths to necessary tools,
using one of the existing files in that folder as an example.
* then run "scons --help" in the root folder of _this_ repo for instructions.

While I regard my part of this work as Public Domain / Kopyleft there are, as
ever, some legal restrictions.  Being partly a derived work based on White
Wolf's intellectual property, anyone (other than them) who tries to sell this
is liable to hear from their lawyers.  On the other hand, some of the
resources I've used--fonts and hyphenation information--are subject to ``open
source'' licenses.  In particular, the OFFO hyphenation library contains files
which must be renamed if modified.
