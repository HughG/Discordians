This repository contains the source for the book *The Manual of Exalted
Power--Discordians*, which is an extension of the *Exalted* 2nd edition game
line produced by White Wolf.

It also contains a number of scripts and configuration files which could be
used to create similar fan-works.  I plan to factor these out into a separate
repository, under the name *Protocol 23*.  For the moment they only run on my
machine (Mac OS 10.6), and include some hard-coded absolute paths
(+fop.xconf+, and the shebangs in the Ruby scripts), but should be usable on
other Unix-alike systems with a little work.

While I regard my part of this work as Kopyleft there are, as ever, some legal
restrictions.  Being partly a derived work based on White Wolf's intellectual
property, anyone (other than them) who tries to sell this is liable to hear
from their lawyers.  On the other hand, some of the resources I've used--fonts
and hyphenation information--are subject to ``open source'' licenses.  In
particular, the OFFO hyphenation library is _not_ free for commercial use.
