* TODO this week

** Charms: Update for 2.5
- General changes
-- Check anything which improves/stacks weapon/armor stats or Rate
-- Perfect defenses are at least 4m more expensive
-- Perfect attacks may be a little more expensive
-- Tick-long and action-long defenses are a little more expensive
-- Combos are free, so "non-Charm activation" Charms are pointless
-- Crippling is easier to resist, in a couple of Charms
-- No perfect equipment
-- Mote gain is not "up to 5 motes" but "up to damage"
- Tags
- Keywords
-- Fate (Sidereal Charms vs. "Might from Will" anima power)
-- Native
-- Martial and Martial-ready
-- Overdrive and Reactor
- General Charm approaches and costs.

** Divisions and Parametadivisions
- Anima powers
-- Might from Will
-- Sub-Division

** Characters
- Fix Kou-an's location

** Fonts
- Need standard and small caps.
- Standard needs [, ], /, ÷, ..., bullet, nbsp?
- Small caps needs /, ÷?, ..., nbsp?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Maybe TODO this week

** 3_Traits
- Quotes for Parametadivisions
- Symbols for Divisions

** Charms: Overall
- Mote pool expanders
- Enough Essence 2 Charms in each Ability
- Enough magic at Essence 2 for Survival (e.g., perfects)
- Appropriate use of Excellencies as prerequisites.
-- Resistance has none!
- Balance per Ability
- Balance per Division
- Maybe Charms which stretch the meaning of an Ability shouldn't be too
deep into Charm trees, otherwise they might not be so widely used.
- Review all which aren't explicitly tagged.
- Remove specific mention of Hodge and Podge as much as possible.
- Remove mention of orange anima glow.
- Remove mention of sobriquets which now belong to Parametadivisons.
- Links to bibitems.

** Editorial
- Fix case of "Backgrounds" and "Storyteller".
- Look for extra hyphens left in by conversion from OpenOffice.

** Online autobuild
