* TODO this week

** Charms
- Name Socialize Charms

** Charms: Update for 2.5
- Keywords
-- Native
-- Martial and Martial-ready
-- Overdrive and Reactor
- General Charm approaches and costs.

** Character Creation
- Move "Thematics" text

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Maybe TODO this week

** Characters
- Fix Kou-an's location (or keep location and change story -- heading to
Varangia?)

** Fonts
- Need standard and small caps.
- Standard needs [, ], /, ÷, ..., bullet, nbsp?
- Small caps needs /, ÷?, ..., nbsp?

** 3_Traits
- Quotes for Parametadivisions
- Images for Divisional Symbols

** Formatting
- Make only the first index lines fully justified.  (May need FOP upgrade.)

** Charms: Overall
- Mote pool expanders
- Enough Essence 2 Charms in each Ability
- Enough magic at Essence 2 for Survival (e.g., perfects)
- Appropriate use of Excellencies as prerequisites.
-- Resistance has none!
- Balance per Ability
- Balance per Division
- Maybe Charms which stretch the meaning of an Ability shouldn't be too
deep into Charm trees, otherwise they might not be so widely used.
- Review all which aren't explicitly tagged.
- Remove specific mention of Hodge and Podge as much as possible.
- Remove mention of sobriquets which now belong to Parametadivisons.
- Links to bibitems.
