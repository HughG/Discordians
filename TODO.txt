- No sobriquets or quotes for Parametadivisions

** Nocturnals
- Parametadivision
- Sobriquets

** Charms: Overall
- Enough Essence 2 Charms in each Ability
- Enough magic at Essence 2 for Survival (e.g., perfects)
- Appropriate use of Excellencies as prerequisites.
-- Resistance has none!
- Balance per Ability
- Balance per Division
- Maybe Charms which stretch the meaning of an Ability shouldn't be too
deep into Charm trees, otherwise they might not be so widely used.
- Review all which aren't explicitly tagged.
