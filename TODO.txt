- Enough Essence 2 Charms in each Ability
- Enough magic at Essence 2 for Survival (e.g., perfects)
- Appropriate use of Excellencies as prerequisites.

- Review all which aren't explicitly tagged.
- Remove specific mention of Hodge and Podge as much as possible.
- Remove mention of orange anima glow.
- Remove mention of sobriquets which now belong to Parametadivisons.
