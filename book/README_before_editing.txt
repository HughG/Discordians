Hi all,

feel free to edit the book here, but please drop me an email or something if you do, just so I know to go and see if some merging is required.  (I have separate copies on my own machine.)

Please also use the styles available, such as Inline Heading (character style).  Don't use bold and italic except for emphasis *within* paragraphs.  If you cut'n'paste stuff I've already written, you shouldn't go far wrong, and I can always tidy it up later.  I'd rather you put stuff in and then I tweak it, than I get no contributions at all :-)

Also, you can open the ".odm" file to see everything all in one file, or to export as PDF, but don't try editing the text within it, because it won't work.  Open the individual files to edit them.

Hugh.
