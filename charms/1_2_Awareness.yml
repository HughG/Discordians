  This Charm supplements any action, removing all external penalties due to the
  character's senses being obscured.  This covers most sensory penalties, such
  as wearing a blindfold, acting in complete darkness, etc.  It does not apply
  to internal penalties such as blindness, however.

  The Chosen of Eris invokes this Charm in response to an attack which is
  initially unexpected, and which she fails to block or dodge.  This Charm is
  applicable even if the character has used some other effect to make it no
  longer unexpected: it works because the attacker believes their attack is a
  surprise.  The character is permitted a counterattack against the original
  attack, and against any other attacks, unexpected or not, until her next
  action.  This Charm does not guarantee that a counterattack is possible (e.g.,
  ranged attackers may not be valid targets), only that the opportunity exists.

  The Wholly Fools see the inner and outer worlds of body and mind as one,
  and may attend to or ignore any part with equal ease.
  
  This Charm has two alternative effects.  Activated in one way, in Step 2 of
  social combat, the character turns his focus inward, ignoring the pressures of
  the outside world.  In this way it provides a perfect social dodge, even
  against social attacks which are undodgeable.  Afterwards, he will remember
  that the attack occurred, who made it (if he was aware of that), and that he
  defended himself against it, but will have no memory of the intent of the
  attack nor the content of the communication which delivered it.
  
  [TODO: Does this need a Flaw of Invulnerability?  Social perfects don't seem
  to have them, in general.]
  
  On the other hand, the character may activate it on Step 1 to turn his focus
  entirely outward.  This enables him to take one action which ignores any
  ongoing Compulsion, Illusion or Emotion effect, or to suppress a Virtue
  without paying a point of Willpower.  This does not allow him to sidestep
  Servitude effects, since their continuing power is focused in the outside
  world, nor does it fend off the impact of Limit Break.  In addition, since he
  is ignoring his Virtues, he cannot channel them on this action.

  With this Charm, the Ignorant Child is able to apply all his senses at every
  point within (Essence x 10) yards simultaneously, regardless of intervening
  barriers.  This effectively means that he can see through walls, behind
  people's backs and so on.  Any external penalties to his senses may be reduced
  by up to (Essence) points, at storyteller discretion, if they do not apply
  over most of the area.  For example, attempting to blind the character by
  shining a light or throwing sand in his eyes will likely be ineffective.
  
  He cannot be surprised by an attack from behind, from cover etc., and
  penalties from coordinated attacks are reduced by (Essence).  The character
  can still be surprised by things which his current senses cannot perceive,
  e.g., attackers who suddenly materialize, or by things which do not appear
  dangerous, e.g., a disguised assassin.
  
  The power of this Charm applies equally well to any unusual senses which the
  character may have, e.g., to see spirits, sense Essence flows etc.  Magical
  protections against scrying or eavesdropping can oppose this Charm, but only
  if they cover a whole area, rather than a boundary.  For example, a Privacy
  Veil (Oadenol's Codex, p. 31) would be ineffective, since it hampers those
  listening through a doorway, whereas an Exalt using this Charm is already
  listening from both sides of the doorway.

  TODO
  
  Using this Charm, one of the Traveling Sailsmen can borrow the senses of a
  succession of beings.  At the point at which the Charm is activated, the
  character must be able to identify the initial target through at least one
  sense, not necessarily sight.  From that point on, the character can observe
  through any of the target's senses, so long as it remains within (Essence)
  miles.  Furthermore, the character can reflexively shift his awareness to any
  other being which the current target can identify, by spending a further 1
  mote of Essence.
  
  When the Charm is activated, and whenever the character attempts to move to a
  new target, the players of the character and the new target make an opposed
  (Awareness + Essence) roll.  The player must obtain at least one success for
  the hop to take effect.  A tie or failure leaves the character's senses in the
  same place as before.  If the player fails and the new target is an Exalt,
  that target may makes a reflexive Awareness roll, difficulty 3, to notice that
  someone was attempting to ride his senses.  If he is somehow able to find the
  source of the effect, it will appear to be coming from wherever the Exalt's
  senses are currently based, i.e., possibly an existing subject of the effect.
  
  The concentration required to read another's senses puts the character at a -2
  internal penalty to be aware of his own surroundings.  He can move at most
  half his normal walking speed, and any actions other than movement will cause
  him to miss details from the borrowed senses.  Note that the character gains
  any benefits of unusual senses which the current target has or activates, but
  is limited to his own understanding to interpret those impressions.  He cannot
  use any Charms through the target.

  Activating this Charm, the Exalt focuses her attention on a single small
  object, often a candle flame.  As long as she maintains her commitment of
  attention and motes, the rate at which she regains Essence, from all sources,
  is multiplied by ([Essence + 1] รท 2) rounded up.  Additionally, she may roll
  to regain Willpower once every (25 รท Essence) hours.
  
  [TODO: Being completely unaware of surroundings and time seems rubbish.  Maybe
  just a -(Essence) penalty to Per+Awr and Join Battle?]
  
  This Charm cannot be used while the character is sleeping or otherwise
  unconscious, and is incompatible with the Charms or other actions which
  require the senses to be focused elsewhere, e.g., Holographic Perception
  Praxis.  While the Charm is in effect, the character is Inactive: she is
  completely unaware of her surroundings, and cannot tell the passage of time,
  though she can tell when she has regained as much Essence as she can.  She may
  choose to end the Charm normally at any time, in which case she remains
  Inactive for (Essence) further actions.  If some gentle stimulus affects the
  character directly, she may ignore it or end the Charm normally.
  
  While in this focused state any attacks are unexpected, unless other effects
  prevent the character from being subject unexpected attacks.  If attacked, or
  at any time, the character may choose to end her meditation abruptly, in which
  case she forfeits all Essence regained in the preceding hour, and becomes
  immediately active, with an effective Join Battle roll of 0.  She cannot
  attack or counterattack until her next action, only reflexively defend.  She
  will suffer a (-Essence) internal penalty to all rolls on her first action,
  this penalty decreasing each action until it reaches 0.

  TODO
  
  This Charm allows the Exalt to impose part or all of his own perceptions on
  the target.  At the point at which the Charm is activated, the character must
  be able to identify the target through at least one sense, not necessarily
  sight.  Thereafter the effect is maintained as long as the target can still be
  sensed or remains within (Essence x 100) yards.
  
  The character may pick out any objects or creatures he can percieve, or even
  general aspects of his own external or internal senses (darkness, nausea
  etc.), to apply to the target's senses.  In the case of objects or creatures,
  he may cause them to appear anywhere around the target, though he cannot
  control their apparent behaviour, unless he can control the actual behaviour
  of the original.
  
  The conentration required to transfer perceptions in this way puts the
  character at a -2 internal penalty to all actions which require use of the
  senses, as long as he maintains the illusion.  Since this Charm constitutes
  unnatural mental influence, it may be resisted as such, and activating it
  gains the character a point of Hodge.

  Those who are a Law Unto Themselves choose their own beliefs, though
  they may accept another's viewpoint if it suits them.
  
  This Charm may be activated whenever the character is subject to an Illusion
  which she could resist in her current state.  Instead of resisting she
  thoroughly accepts it and, in doing so, is able to make it fully real.  For
  the avoidance of doubt, Illusions imposed by the Discordian Investigation
  Charm known as Even False Things are not valid targets for this Charm.
  
  The local flows of Essence are Shaped to match it, to a radius of (Essence x
  10) yards.  Anyone may then be affected by the content of the Illusion:
  weapons do real damage, bridges can be crossed, with mundane and magical
  effects using the traits of the Illusion's creator to determine their power
  (or the minimum trait values, if the creator does not meet them).  These
  changes disappear if the Illusion's creator ends the effect, or some other
  effect undoes the Shaping (which ends the Illusion also), or the character has
  another opportunity to resist the Illusion and successfully does so.  However,
  any consequential changes, such as damage, remain.
  
  This is a Shaping effect that can take place in Creation (or any other realm)
  and makes Shaping attacks and effects as dictated by the content of the
  Illusion.  An Illusion that mimics powerful supernatural entities or phenomena
  will only generate effects mimicing that entity or phenomena's effects to the
  extent that a Shaping action would be able to do so.  The user of this Charm
  has no special protection from these effects, nor control over them, she
  simply allows for Shaping effects to reinforce whatever the Illusion would
  otherwise appear to do.
  
  [TODO: How should this affect the Wyld?  One idea (pre-Fair-Folk-errata) is
  that it should increase the bonuses a character gets for submitting to a
  Fantasy.  Still need to say what to do with Alterations/Restorations,
  Evocations and actual Shaping Combat.]
  
  Use of this Charm does not affect the character's Hodge or Podge rating.
