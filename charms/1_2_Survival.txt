text: Most find comfort behind the ordered walls of civilisation, but the Daughter of Eris smiles and laughs among the chaos of the wildest places.  This Charm supplements a roll to resist environmental damage.  It allows the character to add his Survival rating to the (Stamina + Resistance) roll, guarantees at least one success, and increases the magnitude of the time period until the next check (where the orders of magnitude are: action, minute, hour, day).

This Charm can explicitly be used in conjunction with any Excellency and the bonus dice are not counted towards the normal limit on dice added by Charms.

text: Most find comfort behind the ordered walls of civilisation, but the Daughter of Eris smiles and laughs among the chaos of the wildest places.

This Charm supplements a roll to evade pursuit, laying false trails and making the tracks of the Whistling Voice lead into those of other creatures.  It allows the character to add his Survival rating to the contested (TODO + TODO) roll for pursuit, guaranteeing at least one success.  If the pursuer is sucessfully shaken off, he or she will not simply find a trail gone cold, but will be led to some other local creature, which may or may not be hostile.

text: The balance between order and chaos is closely linked to the balance between predator and prey, nourishment and destruction.  Thus the nature of the Ignorant Children appeals to ignorant beasts.

This Charm supplements a roll to find animals, for food or any other purpose, not by increasing the hunter's skill but by drawing animals (or other local creatures of equivalent intelligence and power) to him.  It allows the character to add his Survival rating to the (TODO + TODO) roll for hunting, guaranteeing at least one success.  If the hunt is successful, the hunter will find that a number of other animals, equal in Magnitude to [TODO: Essence / 2?], have also been drawn in, though they will be of various indigenous types, not necessarily the kind hunted.  The character may thus acquire additional food, or may have to fight local creatures to keep his prize.

text: The Most Beautiful do not deign to have their fair skin lashed by sandstorms, or a lock brushed out of place in an avalanche.  This Charm allows the character to ignore all damage from any one type of environmental damage for one scene.  In addition, he may treat it as an additional Erisian element, for the puposes of applying Elemental Rejuvenation.  The environmental effect must be one which would normally have harmed the character, for this Charm to apply.  This Charm is not applicable to poisons unless they are a pervasive part of the environment, e.g., toxic gases around a volcano.

text: Those who are a Law Unto Themselves do not have quite the primitive, brutal sympathy with other beings which the Lunar Exalted carry in their blood, but they can fake it for a while.

With this Charm the character may take on the appearance of any creature of animal-level intelligence, native to the surrounding environment.  The character does not gain any physical abilities or traits of the creature so mimicked, but will be accepted as what he appears to be by any normal denizen of that habitat.  Those with reason to suspect the Illusion (e.g., Lunars, those able to see Essence flows etc.) may resist its unnatural mental influence as normal, in which case the character gains a point of Hodge (at most one per scene).  Use of any Obvious Charms, or exhibiting any abilities or behaviors which are inappropriate to the animal, automatically ends the illusion, regardless of the presence or absence of witnesses.  The character may shift form once per scene, for an additional expenditure (not committment) of 2 motes of Essence.

text: Where others search intently for those they wish to track, the Discordian Exalt harnesses the twin powers of confusion and laziness, to cause her very surroundings to bring the quarry to her.

This Charm supplements an attempt to pursue some target, temporarily applying subtle Shaping to the environment around said target, to confuse them and herd them towards the Lawbreaker.  This imposes an external penalty equal to the character's Essence on the subject of pursuit.  The alterations to the environment make the path of pursuit more obvious in general, giving a +2 bonus to any others attempting to follow the same quarry (or, indeed, the character) for the next day.  The terrain over which pursuit occurs need not actually be earth: even in the Deep Wyld, this Charm makes bizarre but effective changes to the target's surroundings.

text: "Idealism lives with rules. Realism lives with rocks." - Professor Ignotium P. Ignotius.  Breaking the normal rules of reality, the Blessed of Eris truly becomes one with her surroundings.

Activating this Charm, the character merges herself with the nature of the immediate environment, creating a perfect camouflage: in the East she might appear as a tree, in the West a patch of floating seaweed, and so on.  Her Essence signature, and that of the Charm itself, are also transformed, so that any attempt to detect her in this manner requires a contested roll of (Appearance + Survival) versus the observer's (Perception + Occult), with an external penalty equal to the character's Survival.  Attacks or environmental damage will only affect the character if it would affect the corresponding environment: fire would damage a tree, but not a rock.

While under the effects of this Charm, the character is regarded as Inactive, although she is not actually unconscious and retains her full faculties of observation.  She needs no sustenance beyond what her new form would require.  She cannot voluntarily move, but will be carried along if her surroundings move.  She may choose to end the effects of this Charm at any time and act normally on the immediately following tick.  This Charm is not applicable in artificial structures (e.g., buildings), unless they are in some way the natural environment, as within the body of Autochthon.  It is, however, applicable in realms other than Creation: within Malfeas, for instance, the Silent Wind is itself part of the environment, so the character may avoid its effects by choosing to be swept along as part of it.

Use of this Charm gains the character a point of Podge.

text: Joyful company sustains the soul, and the lone loud voice which is sure of its own location can surely find all other things: "A jug of wine, a leg of lamb and thou! / Beside me, whistling in the darkness."

This Charm replaces the normal Survival roll for route-finding, guaranteeing that the character knows the direction of her desired destination and (if one exists at all) a passable route towards it, as long as the motes remain committed.  The route need not be safe, and it may be passable only by means unavailable to the character, such as sail or flight.  To gain this benefit, the character must continually whistle at a reasonably audible volume, giving a -4 penalty to all Stealth effects, a -2 penalty to evasion of pursuit, and a -2 penalty to communication of all but the simplest of concepts.  The character need not eat or sleep while the whistling continues: she will accumulate fatigue penalties as normal but will not die.  A normal day of food and rest at the Charm's cessation will restore her to her previous level of health.  The character may substitute chanting, humming, gesturing wildly or any other similarly obvious and awkward activity.

text: The beautiful Chaos which is life must sometimes make a trade-off between freedom and security, sacrificing some of its identity to preserve the rest.  This Charm allows other Survival Charms employed by the Anchorite to be extended to a group equal in Magnitude to the character's Essence, as long as the members focus entirely on a word, phrase or mental image which the Priest imparts to them.  This focus prevents the targets from doing anything other than physically following the Exalt and carrying out the basics needed for survival: hunting, foraging, eating, sleeping, remaining alert for predators, and reflexively defending themselves.  This effect constitutes unnatural mental influence; in most cases targets will be expected to accept it, but nonetheless the character gains a single point of Hodge.  Normal animals are assumed to consent unless they are actively hostile towards the character.  The effects also extend to objects owned by the targets, if applicable.  The motes for this Charm must be committed for as long as the other Charm effect(s) which are to be extended.  If this additional commitment ends early, the extended effects persist for one scene, after which the original Charms revert to applying only to the character himself.

text: Some say all roads lead to Meru, but they are wrong.  The strange, dark, twisted corners of reality lead to other, equally strange corners; and in such places are the Children of Chaos fully at home.

This Charm allows the character to travel great distances quickly, but with peculiar limitations.  They may transport themselves and whatever they are able to carry, plus one more similar-sized individual for each point of Essence they possess beyond 3, plus a suitable transport animal or vehicle for the size of group travelling.  At Essence 4, a distance of up to 100 miles may be covered in a day, with each additional level of Essence multiplying the maximum distance by 4.  The end-point of the journey cannot be chosen exactly, since it is reachable so quickly only because of subtle correspondences with the point of origin.  The precisely desired final destination is likely to be around 10 miles away for each 1000 miles covered, and there are no guarantees of safe travel in those last few miles.  There is also no certainty that the mode of transport chosen at the start, e.g., a small boat, will be suitable at the end.

The parallels which allow this kind of travel are capricious concepts, so it may or may not be possible to make a journey between the exact same two end-points on any given occasion.  Travellers should also be aware that their passage will leave both mundane and mystical traces: there may be witnesses at various points on a roughly straight line between the start and end of the route; and in Creation, for example, there will be tell-tale snarls in the Loom of Fate which could be used to find the destination.  However, the fragmented nature of the trail imposes an external penalty on the pursuer equal to the character's (TODO: ESSENCE / 2), rounded up.

If combined with the Mantra of Necessary Union, the Willpower spent on this Charm is per dot of Magnitude of the target group and their mounts of vehicles, rather than per individual.
