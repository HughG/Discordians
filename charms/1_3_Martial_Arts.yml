  The greatest of sifus are prepared even when they are unprepared; they
  do not move from rest to fighting stance, because the two are one for them.
  Among the Ignorant Children, even the youngest may learn this truth.
  
  The character can activate this Charm whenever a Join Battle roll is called
  for.  It adds (Essence) in dice to his roll and, if any other participants
  roll higher, he nonetheless acts on tick 0.

  Masters and Grand-masters spend decades perfecting many forms, but few
  truly understand how to move beyond learning a form, to /being/ the form.
  
  [TODO: This whole Charm is a bit pointless if Form-type Charms are becoming
  Combo-Basic.]
  
  One of the Law who has learned this Charm can use any Form-type Charms she
  knows, without treating that use as a Charm activation, by spending a point of
  Willpower in addition to the Charm's normal cost.  She may still have only one
  Form-type Charm active at any given time.
  
  An additional benefit, though less frequently useful, is that the character
  can more easily switch between forms.  If she ends one Form-type Charm and
  activates another in same tick, she regains the motes spent on the Charm just
  ended, and can use them to pay toward the cost of the new Form-type Charm.
  This does not require the expenditure of Willpower (unless she wants to adopt
  the new Form without a Charm activation).

  Wise men and babies alike think that all things are one.  In combat,
  then, we all strike only at ourselves, and even the most seasoned sage is
  wearied by this realisation at times.  But if all is one, where can one find
  respite from this?  Why, in Limbo, of course, where there are no things!
  
  The Whistling Voice can only use this Charm while he has a Form-type Charm
  active.  When this Charm is activated, he retreats momentarily to gather
  himself -- not into a meditative state, but into Elsewhere.  If invoked in
  response to an attack, it perfectly defends against that attack, unless it is
  unblockable or undodgeable.  (Together, the requirement that a Form-type Charm
  be active, and the imperfection of defense against unblockable and undodgeable
  attacks constitute a unique Flaw of Invulnerability.)  In those cases, the
  character may suffer damage and other effects from the attack, but still
  vanishes immediately.  This means that, for instance, further attacks in a
  flurry cannot target him.  On the other hand, the character may do nothing
  until the tick on which he reappears; indeed, no ticks pass for him, which may
  be relevant to the duration of some effects.
  
  The character's anima flares to the 8-10 mote level on the tick when he
  disappears, and again on the tick when he reappears, unless of course it was
  already flaring at a higher level; if not, it returns to its previous level on
  the following tick.  If something else specificially moves into the
  character's previous location while he is absent, he reappears at the nearest
  point at which there is space for him.  Depending on the storyteller's whim,
  this could leave him with his back to his opponent.
