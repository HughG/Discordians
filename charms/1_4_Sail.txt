Using this Charm, the Travelling Sailsman subverts the instructions given to local weather spirits, and stores the effects of current weather for later use.  The weather in the affected area will revert to a gentle breeze, not quite dead calm.  This is achieved by unnatural mental influence on the local spirits, which they may resist as a group if at least two-thirds spend 1 Willpower each, in which case the character gains a single point of Hodge.  The will of the weather will be stored in some fist-sized, non-magical vessel of the character's choice, either pre-constructed or improvised from materials at hand.

At that point, the stored weather instructions are released upon the local spirits, to be carried out as originally intended, albeit at a different time.  If the release occurs in a significantly different location, the spirits in that location may separately choose to resist these new instructions, again possibly gaining the character a point of Hodge.
