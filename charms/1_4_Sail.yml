  The primal chaos of the sea and the winding currents of the air hold few
  mysteries from those anointed by Eris herself.
  
  This Charm supplements an attempt by a sailing character to detect moving
  objects or static hazards in the environment through which the vehicle is
  travelling -- in the case of a boat, for example, the surrounding air and
  water.  The range of this sense is (Essence x 2) miles.  It does not give a
  clear image of any objects, but will normally be able to distinguish at least
  between rocks, constructed vehicles and natural creatures, on the basis of
  their rough shape.  Any creature down to the size of a human will be
  noticeable, including its approximate location, speed and heading.
  
  As well as providing an instantaneous picture of the character's surroundings,
  this Charm adds the character's Sail rating in dice to her next action, if it
  is a roll to navigation through the area covered, or prediction weather for
  that area.  Beyond that action, moving objects might have changes course, or
  interfering spirits invalidated the prediction, so the bonus no longer
  applies.  Stormy weather or other disturbances may apply an external penalty,
  normally no worse than -2.

  This Charm enhances the Ripple-Reading Insight such that each invocation lasts
  one scene, instead of just a moment.  This means that all Sail actions in that
  scene, to navigate or predict weather, gain the two-die bonus.  In addition,
  the character gains 2 bonus successes when opposing any Stealth effects used
  by beings or objects moving through the range of the Charm.  This bonus does
  not apply to movement which does not continually disturb the environment,
  e.g., moving instantly from outside the range to just next to the character
  for a surprise attack, or moving immaterially.

  To set sail on the ocean is to put oneself at the mercy of the elements;
  best, then, to have a few tricks up your sleeve.  This Charm allows the
  Travelling Sailswoman to hold together a ship or other large vehicle in which
  she is travelling, when it is threatened with destruction.  For each two motes
  spent, she removes 1 health level of post-soak damage to the vehicle.
  
  With Sail 3 and Essence 3, the Exalt can alternatively expend a point of
  Willpower to pull together the remains of a destroyed vehicle, or any suitable
  junk, into a serviceable raft or similar vehicle.  At least half the volume of
  material must be of a type which would be watertight, bouyant and so on.  The
  resulting craft will have one Health Level per two motes expended on its
  construction, all of which are at the Minor Damage (M) level (half Speed and
  Maneuverability, -1 external penalty to piloting rolls).  It will require only
  1 crew member and be capable of carrying (Essence x 2) passengers.  The
  construction may optionally include a mast and, given vaguely suitable
  materials, even sails; it need not be water-bound: sand-ships or gliders can
  also be created.  The resulting craft will last as long as if it had been
  constructed normally.  This Charm cannot repair any damaged magical powers.

  Riding the smallest waves under the hull, the slightest shudder beneath
  the wheels, the Children of Eris can use their unbalanced nature to protect
  those travelling with them.
  
  This Charm allows the character to extend the effects of any Charms which
  improve Dodge, Parry or Soak to the vehicle in which he is travelling,
  including perfect defenses.  This costs an additional 4 motes per Charm or
  Combo activation, thogh this Charm need not be in a Combo with the relevant
  defensive Charms.  The Charm is not valid if the Exalt is not in a vehicle,
  and it does not apply to attacks on individuals on the vehicle (e.g., from
  another being on the vehicle, or using an aimed range attack).

  The ever-shifting curves of water, the manifold cracks of the earth, the
  fragments of cloud in the sky -- all these provide ample hiding places, if
  only one can think small enough.  This Charm subtly shapes the surrounding
  environment to reduce any successes on attempts to notice or track it to zero,
  after all modifiers have been applied.  If this effect is opposed by a perfect
  perception effect, add the character's Essence in automatic successes to the
  opposed roll.
  
  The vehicle cannot be observed by any means, and leaves no tracks.  The effect
  will end immediately if the vehicle changes speed or course, takes a Join
  Battle action or interacts with objects of any significant size.  The vehicle
  may, however, change course at the moment the Charm is activated, depending on
  its maneuverability.  Moving over any terrain which the vehicle would normally
  be able to traverse does not count as interaction with the environment, but
  this Charm does not allow a boat to sail through a harbor wall, for instance.
  
  The Shaping effect employed coincidentally reduces any external penalties to
  the vehicle's movement by the character's Essence.

  The Children of Eris respect the complex balances involved in
  maintaining patterns of weather, but that doesn't prevent them from being
  their usual meddling selves when it suits them.
  
  Using this Charm, the Travelling Sailsman subverts the instructions given to
  local weather spirits, and stores the effects of current weather for later
  use.  The weather in the affected area will revert to a gentle breeze, not
  quite dead calm.  This is achieved by unnatural mental influence on the local
  spirits, which they may resist as a group if at least two-thirds spend 1
  Willpower each, in which case the character gains a single point of Hodge.
  The will of the weather will be stored in some fist-sized, non-magical vessel
  of the character's choice, either pre-constructed or improvised from materials
  at hand.
  
  The weather remains stored until the container is destroyed, the character
  releases the commitment of motes, or the character moves farther from the
  container than the range affected.  At that point, the stored weather
  instructions are released upon the local spirits, to be carried out as
  originally intended, albeit at a different time.  If the release occurs in a
  significantly different location, the spirits in that location may separately
  choose to resist these new instructions, again possibly gaining the character
  a point of Hodge.
  
  The maximum area of effect is (Essence x 10) square miles, and must be a
  roughly circular area centered on the character.  The cost depends on the area
  affected, being (minimum Essence required for the area x 2): 6 motes up to 30
  square miles, 8 motes up to 40 and so on.  The weather to be affected must be
  controlled by beings of Essence no more than the character's own, which may
  also limit the affected area.
  
  The effects of this Charm are not limited to weather goverened by spirits of
  Air or Water, but may be applied to any transient environmental effects of
  equivalent type and power, such as the Omen Weather which heralds demons into
  Creation.  As with most Discordian Charms, this one applies in various realms,
  not only in Creation, although the effects of releasing weather from one realm
  in another are unpredictable.

  One way or another, the Children of Eris seem to have avoided being
  bound by those oaths which reinforce the borders of existence; either that, or
  they're just good at avoided being caught breaking them.  With this Charm, any
  vehicle on which the Anchorite travels may make a five-day journey which leads
  it and its contents into another realm.  The locations which these madmen are
  believed to have visited include Creation, Yu-Shan, the Underworld, Malfeas,
  the Wyld, Autochthonia and, allegedly, even Elsewhere.  The start of the
  journey must be isolated (with very few observers other than those with animal
  intelligence or less) but within a few hours' travel of some at least
  minimally intelligent civilisation.  The destination will be similar, and as
  suitable as possible to the type of vehicle used, but beyond that, the
  character has no control over the exact spot at which the voyage will end.
  
  During the voyage the vehicle will be, for most of the time, undetectable by
  almost any means.  It will appear momentarily in unpredictable locations, not
  necessarily lying in a straight line, five times each day.  It is liable to
  surprise anyone nearby, though it will avoid damage to itself or its
  surroundings.  Except for those brief moments, the passengers will be unable
  to perceive anything beyond the edge of the vehicle.
  
  This Charm is inapplicable unless the character is in a vehicle.  The
  character will be incapable of leaving the ship, voluntarily or accidentally,
  or altering its course until the journey is complete.  Even if he dies, it
  will drift on to the far side of whatever border is being breached.

  Some say all roads lead to Meru, but they are wrong.  The strange, dark,
  twisted corners of reality lead to other, equally strange corners; and in such
  places are the Children of Chaos fully at home.
  
  This Charm allows the character to travel great distances quickly, but with
  peculiar limitations.  They may transport themselves and whatever they are
  able to carry, plus one more similar-sized individual for each point of
  Essence they possess beyond 3, plus a suitable transport animal or vehicle for
  the size of group travelling.  At Essence 4, a distance of up to 250 miles may
  be covered in a day, with each additional level of Essence doubling the
  maximum distance.  The end-point of the journey cannot be chosen exactly,
  since it is reachable so quickly only because of subtle correspondences with
  the point of origin.  The precisely desired final destination is likely to be
  around 10 miles away for each 100 miles covered, and there are no guarantees
  of safe travel in those last few miles.  There is also no certainty that the
  mode of transport chosen at the start, e.g., a small boat, will be suitable at
  the end.
  
  The parallels which allow this kind of travel are capricious concepts, so it
  may or may not be possible to make a journey between the exact same two
  end-points on any given occasion.  Travellers should also be aware that their
  passage will leave both mundane and mystical traces: there may be witnesses at
  various points on a roughly straight line between the start and end of the
  route; and in Creation, for example, there will be tell-tale snarls in the
  Loom of Fate which could be used to find the destination.  However, the
  fragmented nature of the trail imposes an external penalty on the pursuer
  equal to the character's (Essence ÷ 2), rounded up.

  Calling on the capricious benificence of Eris, her Children sing forth a
  blessing in the cadence of five strange, bell-like tones, never the same from
  one occasion to the next.
  
  This Charm allows the Exalt to pay a surchange of 3 motes and 1 point of
  willpower on any activation of a Sail Charm, to extend their effect beyond the
  vessel carrying the Exalt, to a further (character's Essence) vehicles within
  a range of (Essence x 5) miles.  In the case of Convergence of Parallels, the
  blessing multiplies the maximum number of individuals who may be affected by
  (character's Essence), and they may be spread across up to (character's
  Essence) vehicles within range.  The Willpower cost of that Charm is altered
  to be 1 point per vehicle, not per individual.
