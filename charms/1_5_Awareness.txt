The Chosen of Eris invokes this Charm in response to an attack which is initially unexpected, and which she fails to block or dodge.  This Charm is applicable even if the character has used some other effect to make it no longer unexpected: it works because the attacker believes their attack is a surprise.  The character is permitted a counterattack against the original attack, and against any other attacked, unexpected or not, until her next action.  This Charm does not guarantee that a counterattack is possible (e.g., ranged attackers may not be valid targets), only that the opportunity exists.

The name of this Charm comes from the image of changes made in the Loom of Fate, but it works equally well in other sorts of reality.  Activating it allows a character to sense the degree and type of influence which beings or objects are able and likely to have, or have already had, on the world.  This may be due to their raw, Essence-fueled power, to some Destiny, or to mundane Backing or Influence etc.  Beings with awakened Essence of 3 or more are noticeable, as are those with a similar rating in Allies, Backing, Command, Connections, Contacts, Cult, Destiny, Face, Influence or Reputation.  The storyteller may adjust the list of applicable backgrounds.  Artifacts, manses and demesnes rated 3 or more are visible to the character.  Objects and beings lacking any of the above ratings will nevertheless be picked out if they are likely to play, or have played, a vital part in some pivotal event, e.g., an assassination.

The character will automatically know which traits or types of events make each object or being notable, but will not know trait ratings or details of events.  To gain more detailed knowledge the character may make a (Perception + Awareness) roll.  Knowing the rating of a single trait is difficulty 2, as is getting an approximate timing for past events.  Seeing some detail of specific individuals or power groups involved in Backgrounds, or of the role an object or being played in past events, is difficulty 4.  Trying to determine future events, associations or tendencies adds 2 to the difficulty; and, of course, the future may change before it becomes the present.

The name of this Charm comes from the image of gaps and holes in the Loom of Fate, but it works equally well in other sorts of reality.  Activating it allows a character to sense objects and beings which are hidden or disguised.  The true appearance of such things is not revealed, but their locations and the types of concealment are.

For hidden, invisible or immaterial things, this Charm halves any penalties to the character's interactions with them.  Stealth or similar effects which would completely prevent the character from interacting with a target instead impose a -4 external penalty.  This Charm does not in itself grant the ability to interact with immaterial beings.

Disguised things are revealed as such, including the nature of the disguise.  This Charm reveals mundane and magical disguises, including those using Lunar shapeshifting, Sidereal astrology, and any unnatural mental influences which cause the character to mistake the true nature of something.  (This does not count as resisting the unnatural mental influence directly, so does not accrue Podge.)  However, the identity of the disguised person or object remains unknown.  If the digsuise itself imposes any penalties on the character, they are halved.  Furthermore, the character may add 2 dice to any rolls (of any Ablity) to see through or undo the disguise.

With this Charm, the Ignorant Child is able to apply all his senses at every point within (Essence x 10) yards simultaneously, regardless of intervening barriers.  This effectively means that he can see through walls, behind people's backs and so on.  Any external penalties to his senses may be reduced by up to (Essence) points, at storyteller discretion, if they do not apply over most of the area.  For example, attempting to blind the character by shining a light or throwing sand in his eyes will likely be ineffective.

He cannot be surprised by an attack from behind, from cover etc., and penalties from coordinated attacks are reduced by (Essence).  The character can still be surprised by things which his current senses cannot perceive, e.g., attackers who suddenly materialize, or by things which do not appear dangerous, e.g., a disguised assassin.

The power of this Charm applies equally well to any unusual senses which the character may have, e.g., to see spirits, sense Essence flows etc.  Magical protections against scrying or eavesdropping can oppose this Charm, but only if they cover a whole area, rather than a boundary.  For example, a Privacy Veil (Oadenol's Codex, p. 31) would be ineffective, since it hampers those listening through a doorway, whereas an Exalt using this Charm is already listening from both sides of the doorway.

Using this Charm, one of the Traveling Sailsmen can borrow the senses of a succession of beings.  At the point at which the Charm is activated, the character must be able to identify the initial target through at least one sense, not necessarily sight.  From that point on, the character can observe through any of the target's senses, so long as it remains within (Essence) miles.  Furthermore, the character can reflexively shift his awareness to any other being which the current target can identify, by spending a further 1 mote of Essence.

When the Charm is activated, and whenever the character attempts to move to a new target, the players of the character and the new target make an opposed (Awareness + Essence) roll.  The player must obtain at least one success for the hop to take effect.  A tie or failure leaves the character's senses in the same place as before.  If the player fails and the new target is an Exalt, that target may makes a reflexive Awareness roll, difficulty 3, to notice that someone was attempting to ride his senses.  If he is somehow able to find the source of the effect, it will appear to be coming from wherever the Exalt's senses are currently based, i.e., possibly an existing subject of the effect.

The concentration required to read another's senses puts the character at a -2 internal penalty to be aware of his own surroundings.  He can move at most half his normal walking speed, and any actions other than movement will cause him to miss details from the borrowed senses.  Note that the character gains any benefits of unusual senses which the current target has or activates, but is limited to his own understanding to interpret those impressions.  He cannot use any Charms through the target.

Activating this Charm, the Exalt focuses her attention on a single small object, often a candle flame.  As long as she maintains her commitment of attention and motes, the rate at which she regains Essence, from all sources, is multiplied by ([Essence + 1] ÷ 2) rounded up.  Additionally, she may roll to regain Willpower once every 12 hours.

This Charm cannot be used while the character is sleeping or otherwise unconscious, and is incompatible with the Charms or other actions which require the senses to be focused elsewhere, e.g., Holographic Perception Praxis.  While the Charm is in effect, the character is Inactive: she is completely unaware of her surroundings, and cannot tell the passage of time, though she can tell when she has regained as much Essence as she can.  She may choose to end the Charm normally at any time, in which case she remains Inactive for (Essence) further actions.  If some gentle stimulus affects the character directly, she may ignore it or end the Charm normally.

While in this focused state any attacks are unexpected, unless other effects prevent the character from being subject unexpected attacks.  If attacked, or at any time, the character may choose to end her meditation abruptly, in which case she forfeits all Essence regained in the preceding hour, and becomes immediately active, with an effective Join Battle roll of 0.  She cannot attack or counterattack until her next action, only reflexively defend.  She will suffer a (-Essence) internal penalty to all rolls on her first action, this penalty decreasing each action until it reaches 0.

This Charm allows the Exalt to impose part or all of his own perceptions on the target.  At the point at which the Charm is activated, the character must be able to identify the target through at least one sense, not necessarily sight.  Thereafter the effect is maintained as long as the target can still be sensed or remains within (Essence x 100) yards.

The character may pick out any objects or creatures he can percieve, or even general aspects of his own external or internal senses (darkness, nausea etc.), to apply to the target's senses.  In the case of objects or creatures, he may cause them to appear anywhere around the target, though he cannot control their apparent behaviour, unless he can control the actual behaviour of the original.

The conentration required to transfer perceptions in this way puts the character at a -2 internal penalty to all actions which require use of the senses, as long as he maintains the illusion.  Since this Charm constitutes unnatural mental influence, it may be resisted as such, and activating it gains the character a point of Hodge.

This Charm may be activated whenever the character is subject to an Illusion which she could resist in her current state.  Instead of resisting she thoroughly accepts it and, in doing so, is able to make it fully real.

The local flows of Essence are Shaped to match it, to a radius of (Essence x 10) yards.  Anyone may then be affected by the content of the Illusion: weapons do real damage, bridges can be crossed, with mundane and magical effects using the traits of the Illusion's creator to determine their power (or the minimum trait values, if the creator does not meet them).  These changes disappear if the Illusion's creator ends the effect, or some other effect undoes the Shaping (which ends the Illusion also), or the character has another opportunity to resist the Illusion and successfully does so.  However, any consequential changes, such as damage, remain.

[TODO: How should this affect the Wyld?]

Use of this Charm does not affect the character's Hodge or Podge rating.
