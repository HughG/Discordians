[TODO: Review once Ink Monkeys have finished playing around with Martial-ready stuff.]

This Charm, applied in Step 1 of attack resolution, summons the Erisian's Archery weapon to his hand, from any point up to (Essence x 5) yards away.  The weapon must be one which the character owns.  It travels via Elsewhere, meaning that most bindings, even magical ones, will not prevent it from returning to his hand.  The character may use this Charm to reflexively ready a weapon and attack in the same action.

The character may also apply this Charm to any reusable ammunition from an attack, summoning it back to his hand either before or after raw damage is calculated.  If the ammunition is summoned back before the damage calculation, no damage is done and no poison or other contact effects apply, but the target may still take advantage of any counterattacks available.  If the ammunition is specifically destroyed, it cannot be summoned back.

text: It is hard to defend against things you cannot see or touch, even if you know they are coming.  The Invader of the Faith sends her shot on an esoteric curve through Elsewhere, reappearing at exactly the right time to strike the target.

This Charm supplements an Archery attack in a number of ways.  It applies a -2 external penalty to the defender's DVs, unless he or she can somehow see into Elsewhere.  It causes the attack to ignore any Hardness due to armour or any similar protections beyond the target's own skin, and to ignore DV bonuses due to cover.  It furthermore effectively allows shots to pass through solid objects, though some magical wards may prevent this.  If the character cannot otherwise percieve the target through any such objects, the attack will suffer an external penalty as severe as blindness (-4), unless some other effect improves the situation.

[TODO: Should probably say it ignores soak from armor, too, in which case this is quite powerful, and should go up in cost.  Should clarify that it doesn't ignore natural or Charm-added soak.]

This Charm supplements a character's Archery attack by suspending it within Elsewhere immediately after it is launched, ready to be resumed at a later point in time.  Step 1 of attack resolution is carried out, including any expenditure of motes for other Charms, but without naming a target.  The arrow, jet of flame or other projectile is fired but vanishes.  It remains Elsewhere as long as the character maintains the commitment of motes for this Charm, plus the mote cost of all other Charms, if used in a Combo.

The motes may be released at any later point as a reflexive action, including as a counterattack, causing the attack to be resumed.  This does not count as a Charm use.  The character need not be wielding the weapon at the time, though they can still only choose a target which would be valid at the point when the motes are released.

[TODO: Limit the number of stored attacks, e.g., to Essence.  Also, note that attacks released are not inherently unexpected.]

dur: Instant
dep: exc
text: Even things that go wrong can go right sometimes.  With the Fletcher's Rejoinder, an Exalt's mischievous will is extended into her projectile, allowing attacks which miss to loop around and return for a second attack.

This Charm enhances an Archery attack such that, if the attack fails because the arrow missed (whether due to the attacker's inaccuracy or the target dodging), or was deflected by Hardness or a parry, then the projectile returns, allowing the same attack to be re-rolled on the following tick, with no speed cost or DV penalty.  If the attack fails because of the target's soak, the arrow falls harmlessly to the ground and the Charm is ineffective; similarly if the arrow is otherwise destroyed or its flight specifically ended on the first attack.  If the first attack was part of a Combo, the second attack may optionally have the same Combo applied, with the cost paid again.  This Charm itself may be used on the second attack, alone or as part of a Combo, enabling third and further attacks, but each attack beyond the second is at a cumulative -1 penalty to accuracy and damage.

Some Discordians have been known to use this Charm and deliberately miss on their first attack.  In this case, the second attack is treated similarly to an ambush: roll the attacker's (Dexterity + Archery) against the defender's (Wits + Awareness), with appropriate penalties or bonuses depending on the defender's wariness.  Failure gives the defender a Dodge and Parry DV of 0.  However, if the defender has already seen this technique used in the same story, they gain a +2 bonus to the contested roll.

This Charm allows the Moonlight Lyre to use any vaguely suitable small objects as ammunition for her bow, flame piece or other Archery weapon.  The effects of any standard type of arrow may be reproduced, though the storyteller may apply bonuses or penalties depending on materials available.  Dust, grains, pebbles and so on may be used as firewand ammunition, but the range will be halved unless the substance is easily flammable, and the damage will be be bashing, not lethal, unless it is particularly hard and sharp.  Reloading with easily reachable objects from her surroundings will take the character no longer than normal for the weapon in question.  The storyteller may impose a Speed penalty, or require extra actions to reload, if suitable objects are harder to reach, however.

Unless other effects apply, the improvised items of ammunition must be normal, physical objects, though they might be magical objects.  They must be of approximately normal size and weight for the weapon in question, but they need not be particuarly aerodynamic.  This Charm removes any accuracy penalties which the character would otherwise suffer due to these weapons being improvised.

By spending a further 2 motes, the Discordian can also improvise any mundane sort of bow if vaguely suitable materials are available.  The bow will cease to function as such after the scene ends.

This Charm provides the Exalt with a magical flurry of two or more Archery-based attacks.  Each attack costs 2 motes, including the first, and the character may make a number of attacks up to his permanent Essence, regardless of the weapon's Rate.  The Charm allows her to make these attacks without multiple action penalties and with a DV penalty equal to the highest penalty for any one attack.  For weapons with a Rate less than 1, the character must spend one (or more) of her extra actions reloading the weapon after each attack.

[TODO: Add more Discordian flavor/effects?]

Just as the Children of Eris are many and disparate in their activities, so are their projectile attacks.  This Charm supplements an Archery attack, splitting one item of ammunition into a number of duplicates up to (her permanent Essence score).  All are aimed at the same target with attack, defense and damage rolled separately for each.  However, each attack is at a -1 accuracy penalty and a -(number of extra attacks) damage penalty; for instance, three attacks would each suffer -1 to accuracy and -2 to damage.  If Handful of Pebbles attack is used with ammunition costing more than one dot of Resources per shot or placed in a Combo with Charms that affect the arrow's accuracy or damage, the cost per duplicate is doubled.

[TODO: Maybe drop cost -- check Archery changes in recent errata.  Also, add more Discordian flavor/effects?]

This Charm supplements an Archery action by allowing the character to use himself as ammunition.  This allows him to Jump towards his target, up to one tenth the range which the attack would otherwise have.  If the action is an attack, the character may make an unarmed attack, or one which uses weapons which can be wielded at the same time as his current Archery weapon (e.g., a smashfist worn while using a bow).  This attack gains the Knockback keyword, and is treated as part of the same attack, using the Archery attack roll to hit, but the other weapon's details to determine damage in Step 7.  This Charm may be used in a flurry, but attacks beyond the first in the flurry do not gain the Knockback keyword from this Charm.

By spending a point of Willpower the Soft and Steady Hand can Jump up to the full range of his weapon.  If the attack's range has been extended by other magics, the storyteller may rule that the Jump lasts more than one action.

When using this Charm, the character may make a (Dexterity + Archery) roll to catch his weapon as he jumps, and take it with him if successful.  Failure means that the weapon remains at the origin of the jump.  Note also that this Charm need not necessarily be used as an attack: it could be used to allow the character to jump up to a high balcony, for example.

type: Supplemental
key: Combo-OK, Emotion
dur: One scene or Special
dep: sasa
text: As recounted in stories of old, a well-timed magical arrow can influence the course of people's lives.  Erisians bring these legends to life with Piercing the Heart: the Exalt mimes shooting an arrow, firewand or similar -- a weapon is required, but no ammunition is actually used -- and sends an invisible bolt of Essence, carrying emotional influence towards a single target.  The attack causes no damage, is unblockable with mundane weapons or armor, applies a -2 external penalty to the target's DV due to its invisibilty, and is unaffected by Hardness or soak.  Steps 7 and 8 of attack resolution will be irrelevant, unless some unusual Reflexive Charm applies.

If the attack achieves even one success, this Charm inspires any one desired emotion intensely for one scene.  Resisting the influence costs two Willpower, and will make the target aware of the attempt at unnatural influence.

By spending an additional 3 motes and 1 Willpower, the Exalt can cause the emotion to fade gradually over the course of (character's Essence) days.  After the first scene, the effect can be resisted for only one Willpower.  However, even once they have resisted it, the target will tend to regard the temporary emotional aberrance as having been genuinely their own, fabricating some convincing explanation for themselves, until the Charm's duration ends.  If they are to recognise and remember the unnatural effect once the Charm has ended, they must spend a further 2 Willpower (or 1 Willpower, if they have recognised this Charm's used on themselves or others before); after that they become permanently aware of what happened.  Witnesses may spend 1 Willpower to realise the source of the emotion provided they saw the Exalt's attack, but they may do this at any time at or after that initial attack.

Using this attack does not end Stealth effects unless the target successfully resists the influence using Willpower at the moment of the initial attack.  This Charm gains the character a point of Hodge.

[TODO: Richard says "yuk".  Maybe something to shoot at another attack, as a perfect defend other?]

[TODO: Actually accounting for the undone effects, over more than one action, could be just too painful in practice, specially if there are several combatants all affecting each other.  Maybe this should be max 1 action?  Then again, Sidereals have a Dodge Charm which does something similar.]

This Charm allows the Moonlight Lyre to bend and loop the flow of time, undoing what has happened in recent moments.  It is activated in Step 10 of attack resolution, for an attack either by or upon the character.  All effects and damage applied to either, from any source, within the last (Essence) actions, are undone.  Any Essence, Willpower or other costs paid towards those effects (by any parties involved, not just the character and his opponent) are refunded, except for the cost of this Charm.  Nobody except the character will have any memory of what happened within that closed-off loop of time, unless they have awakened Essence and spend 2 points of Willpower to recall it.  Everyone else will experience a strange moment of deja-vu or similar confusion, but not realise what un-happened.

Using this Charm gains the character a point of Hodge.  The Charm may be inapplicable in areas or against opponents specifically warded against Shaping.  However, the Charm does not count as an attack and does not modify inherent traits of the target, so Charms such as the Solars' Integrity-Protecting Prana are ineffective against it.  This Charm may also be used to undo effects related to an unrelated being, who is not attacking the character, in which case it requires direct contact as if it had the Touch keyword.

dur: Instant

text: TODO

This Charm supplements an Archery-based attack by the character, rapidly opening and closing a semi-stable portal to Elsewhere at the point of impact, causing a violent upsetting of the target's balance.  The target must roll his (Stamina + Resistance) againt the character's (Strength + Archery).  The attack must hit (i.e., not be dodged or parried), but need not inflict damage.  If the target fails this check, he is knocked prone (as a Knockdown effect, rather than Knockback).

By spending a point of Willpower in addition, the character can force all beings within (Essence x 3) yards of the point of impact to check for Knockback, each rolling (Stamina + Resistance) againt the character's (Strength + Archery).  Inanimate objects up to roughly human mass will, if they are not fastened down, also be knocked back.  If the target dodged or parried the attack, they must make a second check to avoid being knocked back from wherever the projectile landed.  If the Erisian herself is within this radius, she will not be knocked back, and her affinity with dynamic chaos means she will "luckily" avoid being hit by any flying objects.

The character may make this attack without any ammunition, simply by miming an attack using a suitable weapon.  In this case, the target will not suffer damage from the attack itself, but is at a -4 penalty to his DV, since the only indication of the impact will be a shimmering in the air at the last moment.
