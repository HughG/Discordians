  This Charm, applied in Step 1 of attack resolution, summons the Erisian's
  Archery weapon to his hand, from any point up to (Essence x 2) yards away.
  The weapon must be one which the character owns.  It travels via Elsewhere,
  meaning that most bindings, even magical ones, will not prevent it from
  returning to his hand.  The character may use this Charm to reflexively ready
  a weapon and attack in the same action.
  
  The character may also apply this Charm to any reusable ammunition from an
  attack, summoning it back to his hand either before or after raw damage is
  calculated.  If the ammunition is summoned back before the damage calculation,
  no damage is done and no poison or other contact effects apply, but the target
  may still take advantage of any counterattacks available.  If the ammunition
  is specifically destroyed, it cannot be summoned back.
  
  A second purchase at Archery 3 and Essence 3 allows the character to use the
  Charm with an Indefinite duration, applied to a weapon, suspending it in
  Elsewhere.  It will remain there as long as the motes remain committed.  When
  they are reflexively released, it will appear in his hand, or fall to the
  ground at his feet if both hands are occupied.

  It is hard to defend against things you cannot see or touch, even if you
  know they are coming.  The Invader of the Faith sends her shot on an esoteric
  curve through Elsewhere, reappearing at exactly the right time to strike the
  target.
  
  This Charm supplements an Archery attack in a number of ways.  It applies a -2
  external penalty to the defender's DVs, unless he or she can somehow see into
  Elsewhere.  It causes the attack to ignore any Hardness or soak due to armour
  or any similar protections beyond the target's own skin, and to ignore DV
  bonuses due to cover.  It does not cause the attack to ignore natural soak, or
  soak added by Charms.  It furthermore effectively allows shots to pass through
  solid objects, though some magical wards may prevent this.  If the character
  cannot otherwise percieve the target through any such objects, the attack will
  suffer an external penalty as severe as blindness (-4), unless some other
  effect improves the situation.

  This Charm supplements a character's Archery attack by suspending it within
  Elsewhere immediately after he launches it, ready to be resumed at a later
  point in time.  Step 1 of attack resolution is carried out, including any
  expenditure of motes for other Charms, but without naming a target.  The
  arrow, jet of flame or other projectile is fired but vanishes.  It remains
  Elsewhere as long as the character maintains the commitment of motes for this
  Charm, plus the mote cost of all other Charms, if used in a Combo.  The
  character can store at most (Essence) projectiles in Elsewhere using this
  Charm.
  
  The motes may be released at any later point as a reflexive action, including
  as a counterattack, causing the attack to be resumed.  This does not count as
  a Charm use.  The character need not be wielding the weapon at the time,
  though they can still only choose a target which would be valid at the point
  when the motes are released.  A slight disturbance in the air as the
  projectile reappears means that this Charm does not in itself make the attack
  unexpected.

  Even things that go wrong can go right sometimes.  With the Fletcher's
  Rejoinder, an Exalt's mischievous will is extended into her projectile,
  allowing attacks which miss to loop around and return for a second attack.
  
  This Charm enhances an Archery attack such that, if the attack fails because
  the arrow missed (whether due to the attacker's inaccuracy or the target
  dodging), or was deflected by Hardness or a parry, then the projectile
  returns, allowing the same attack to be re-rolled on the following tick, with
  no speed cost or DV penalty.  If the attack fails because of the target's
  soak, the arrow falls harmlessly to the ground and the Charm is ineffective;
  similarly if the arrow is otherwise destroyed or its flight specifically ended
  on the first attack.  If the first attack was part of a Combo, the second
  attack may optionally have the same Combo applied, with the cost paid again.
  This Charm itself may be used on the second attack, alone or as part of a
  Combo, enabling third and further attacks, but each attack beyond the second
  is at a cumulative -1 penalty to accuracy and damage.
  
  Some Discordians have been known to use this Charm and deliberately miss on
  their first attack.  In this case, the second attack is treated similarly to
  an ambush: roll the attacker's (Dexterity + Archery) against the defender's
  (Wits + Awareness), with appropriate penalties or bonuses depending on the
  defender's wariness.  Failure gives the defender a Dodge and Parry DV of 0.
  However, if the defender has already seen this technique used in the same
  story, they gain a +2 bonus to the contested roll.

  This Charm allows the Moonlight Lyre to use any vaguely suitable small objects
  as ammunition for her bow, flame piece or other Archery weapon.  The effects
  of any standard type of arrow may be reproduced, though the storyteller may
  apply bonuses or penalties depending on materials available.  Dust, grains,
  pebbles and so on may be used as firewand ammunition, but the range will be
  halved unless the substance is easily flammable, and the damage will be be
  bashing, not lethal, unless it is particularly hard and sharp.  Reloading with
  easily reachable objects from her surroundings will take the character no
  longer than normal for the weapon in question.  The storyteller may impose a
  Speed penalty, or require extra actions to reload, if suitable objects are
  harder to reach, however.
  
  Unless other effects apply, the improvised items of ammunition must be normal,
  physical objects, though they might be magical objects.  They must be of
  approximately normal size and weight for the weapon in question, but they need
  not be particuarly aerodynamic.  This Charm removes any accuracy penalties
  which the character would otherwise suffer due to these weapons being
  improvised.
  
  By spending a further 2 motes, the Discordian can also improvise any mundane
  sort of bow if vaguely suitable materials are available.  The bow will cease
  to function as such after the scene ends.

  The Children of Eris strive against any and all rules which do not suit
  them, including the rules of time which prevent all things happening at once.
  Pulling a handful of instants together around her, she launches several
  separate attacks in one.
  
  This Charm provides the Exalt with a magical flurry of two or more
  Archery-based attacks.  Each attack costs 3 motes, including the first, and
  the character may make a number of attacks up to (her permanent Essence),
  regardless of the weapon's Rate.  The Charm allows her to make these attacks
  without multiple action penalties and with a DV penalty equal to the highest
  penalty for any one attack.  The Speed of the combined actions is one more
  than the Speed of the longest single action.  For weapons with a Rate less
  than 1, the character must spend one (or more) of her extra actions reloading
  the weapon after each attack.
  
  At Essence 3, the character may additionally spend 1 point of Willpower to
  spread her awareness into another half a moment, allowing her to ignore all DV
  penalties from these attacks (but not from other sources).

  Just as the Children of Eris are many and disparate in their activities, so
  are their projectile attacks.  This Charm supplements an Archery attack,
  splitting one item of ammunition into a number of duplicates up to (her
  permanent Essence score).  All are aimed at the same target with attack,
  defense and damage rolled separately for each.  However, each attack is at a
  -1 accuracy penalty and a -(number of extra attacks) damage penalty; for
  instance, three attacks would each suffer -1 to accuracy and -2 to damage.  If
  Handful of Pebbles attack is used with ammunition costing more than one dot of
  Resources per shot or placed in a Combo with Charms that affect the arrow's
  accuracy or damage, the cost per duplicate is doubled.

  This Charm supplements an Archery action by allowing the character to use
  himself as ammunition.  This allows him to Jump towards his target, up to one
  tenth the range which the attack would otherwise have.  If the action is an
  attack, the character may make an unarmed attack, or one which uses weapons
  which can be wielded at the same time as his current Archery weapon (e.g., a
  smashfist worn while using a bow).  This attack gains the Knockback keyword,
  and is treated as part of the same attack, using the Archery attack roll to
  hit, but the other weapon's details to determine damage in Step 7.  This Charm
  may be used in a flurry, but attacks beyond the first in the flurry do not
  gain the Knockback keyword from this Charm.
  
  By spending a point of Willpower the Soft and Steady Hand can Jump up to the
  full range of his weapon.  If the attack's range has been extended by other
  magics, the storyteller may rule that the Jump lasts more than one action.
  
  When using this Charm, the character may make a (Dexterity + Archery) roll to
  catch his weapon as he jumps, and take it with him if successful.  Failure
  means that the weapon remains at the origin of the jump.  Note also that this
  Charm need not necessarily be used as an attack: it could be used to allow the
  character to jump up to a high balcony, for example.

  As recounted in stories of old, a well-timed magical arrow can influence
  the course of people's lives.  Erisians bring these legends to life with
  Piercing the Heart: the Exalt mimes shooting an arrow, firewand or similar --
  a weapon is required, but no ammunition is actually used -- and sends an
  invisible bolt of Essence, carrying emotional influence towards a single
  target.  The attack causes no damage, is unblockable with mundane weapons or
  armor, applies a -2 external penalty to the target's DV due to its
  invisibilty, and is unaffected by Hardness or soak.  Steps 7 and 8 of attack
  resolution will be irrelevant, unless some unusual Reflexive Charm applies.
  
  If the attack achieves even one success, this Charm inspires any one desired
  emotion intensely for one scene.  Resisting the influence costs two Willpower,
  and will make the target aware of the attempt at unnatural influence.
  
  By spending an additional 3 motes and 1 Willpower, the Exalt can cause the
  emotion to fade gradually over the course of (character's Essence) days.
  After the first scene, the effect can be resisted for only 1 Willpower.
  However, even once they have resisted it, the target will tend to regard the
  temporary emotional aberrance as having been genuinely their own, fabricating
  some convincing explanation for themselves, until the Charm's duration ends.
  If they are to recognise and remember the unnatural effect once the Charm has
  ended, they must spend a further 2 Willpower, after which they become
  permanently aware of what happened.  Witnesses may spend 1 Willpower to
  realise the source of the emotion provided they saw the Exalt's attack, but
  they may do this at any time at or after that initial attack.
  
  Using this attack does not end any Stealth effects on the character, unless
  the target successfully resists the influence using Willpower at the moment of
  the initial attack.

  This Charm allows the Moonlight Lyre to bend and loop the flow of time,
  loosing an arrow to meet an incoming attack at precisely the right instant to
  knock it off track.  This perfectly defends against any attack, even if it is
  unblockable.  Furthermore, the character can use this Charm in a Defend Other
  action to defend any other being who would be a valid target for an Archery
  attack by her, by shooting down an attack as it heads toward that target.  By
  spending 1 point of Willpower, the character can even apply this Charm without
  ammunition, by miming it with a suitable weapon.  In this case, the Charm
  gains the Obvious keyword, as a strange ripple of distorted moments passes
  through the air on the way to deflect the attack.  This Charm is subject to
  one of the Discordian Flaws of Invulnerability.

  This Charm supplements an Archery-based attack by the character, rapidly
  opening and closing a semi-stable portal to Elsewhere at the point of impact,
  causing a violent upsetting of the target's balance.  The target must roll his
  (Stamina + Resistance) againt the character's (Strength + Archery).  The
  attack must hit (i.e., not be dodged or parried), but need not inflict damage.
  If the target fails this check, he is knocked prone (as a Knockdown effect,
  rather than Knockback).
  
  By spending an extra two motes and a point of Willpower, the character can
  force all beings within (Essence x 3) yards of the point of impact to check
  for Knockback, each rolling (Stamina + Resistance) againt the character's
  (Strength + Archery).  Inanimate objects up to roughly human mass will, if
  they are not fastened down, also be knocked back.  If the target dodged or
  parried the attack, they must make a second check to avoid being knocked back
  from wherever the projectile landed.  If the Erisian herself is within this
  radius, she will not be knocked back, and her affinity with dynamic chaos
  means she will "luckily" avoid being hit by any flying objects.
  
  The character may make this attack without any ammunition, simply by miming an
  attack using a suitable weapon.  In this case, the target will not suffer
  damage from the attack itself, but is at a -4 penalty to his DV, since the
  only indication of the impact will be a shimmering in the air at the last
  moment.

  [TODO: Should mins be 4/4? or just 4/3?  Should duration be Indefinite or One
  scene?  What should the cost be?  Should probably include Willpower.]
  
  This Charm creates a stable, if short-lived, pair of portals to Elsewhere.
  The first portal is created at the point of impact of the shot to which this
  Charm is applied, and the second wherever the character's next shot (with the
  same weapon) lands.  Subsequent shots alternately relocate the first and
  second portals.  The character cannot choose for a shot not to move a portal,
  unless it lands out of range, or the character uses a different weapon.
  [TODO: Is this limitation reasonable?  Or should it be a reflexive (Step 1)
  choice?  Should it cost a mote each time?]
  
  When only the first portal is open, objects or beings which enter it are
  suspended in Elsewhere.  It appears as a flat, translucent grey disc with
  fringed edges, (Essence x 2) feet wide and with almost no depth.  It can be
  seen from both sides but can only be entered from the side from which the
  projectile struck.  Those walking into it from the other side will pass
  through it as though it were entirely insubstantial.  Those looking through
  this translucent surface suffer a -2 external penalty to vision, including the
  accuracy of attacks passing through it.  The space beyond this single portal
  is featureless grey, has no particular shape, and a volume roughly equal to
  a sphere with a diameter matching the portal.  If the space is filled before
  the second portal appears, nothing else can enter.
  
  When the second portal appears, anything which entered the first portal
  immediately exits through it.  Once both are open, anything passing into
  either portal immediately reappears from the other.  In any case, objects and
  beings emerge from one portal with the same speed they had when they entered
  the other, but with their direction of movement adjusted as if the two portals
  were back to back.  Anyone looking into either portal from its active side
  will see the view from the other portal.  Anyone looking at either portal from
  the other side, however, will see straight through it.  In both cases, vision
  is still subject to the -2 penalty due to the grey haze of a thin layer of
  Elsewhere.  Any number of beings or object may pass freely through the portals
  at a time, provided they fit through, as if they formed a mundane doorway.
  
  As long as there is only a single portal, any being or automaton may find a
  way back out on a successful Willpower roll, against a difficulty of the
  Discordian's Essence, in which case they similarly emerge at their original
  speed, but moving in the opposite direction.
  
  The portals cannot be moved except by the character taking further shots.
  They can be at most (Essence x 100) yards apart, and shots which land further
  from the relevant portal will not cause its twin to move.  It is explicitly
  permitted for the character to fire a shot through a portal, which will cause
  that portal to relocate when it hits, provided the distance limit is not
  exceeded.  It is not impossible to have each portal in a different realm of
  existence, if the character manages to fire through some other other
  pre-existing gateway.  In that case, the distance is calculated as the sum of
  two straight lines, from each portal to the pre-existing gateway.
