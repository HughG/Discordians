text: All things are one, if seen from the right angle.  This maxim is most often used in dissolving the boundaries between concepts, but it can also lead one to the secret of capturing many observations in one instance.

This Charm allows the character to instantly record a precise memory of the scene around them, for later Investigation rolls or other normal uses of memory.  The scope of the scene is at least a radius of (Essence x 5) yards, possibly more if there is little detail in the scene.  The memory will include only what the character was able to sense at that moment, though they may turn on the spot in order to gain a full 360-degree record.  The effect lasts as long as the motes remain committed, meaning that the it could be subjected to several Investigation actions if time allows, or more information is gained from other sources.  The memory is also unnaturally clear, allowing the character to double sensory limits -- e.g., on seeing through fog, or reading letters -- within the affected range.

This Charm supplements an Investigation action to provide the character with knowledge of how to alter evidence to affect the conclusions which later investigators are likely to draw.  For each success on the Investigation roll, the Moonlight Lyre immediately understands one change which could be made to alter a specific observation.  For example, she might see how to make a lock appear to have been picked rather than forced, make a footprint seem to be male rather than female, or even how to make an outright lie sound like a half-truth.  If these changes are made, by the character or anyone else, the adjustments will be undetectable by mundane means.  Detection by supernatural means requires a contested roll of the character's (Intelligence + [Investigation or Larceny]) versus the other investigator's (Perception + Investigation).  Making the changes takes a tenth of the time it normally would, assuming the character is able to do so.

text: As a well-known old mind-bender once said, "we leak the truth from every pore".  Those of the Soft and Steady Hand can seive the words and non-verbal cues they receive from those around them to find, if not the truth, at least the holes between.

Activating this Charm allows the character to recognise all deliberate lies or half-truths he observes during the scene, whether communicated verbally or by facial expression etc.  In the case of a half-truth, the character will know which parts are believed to be a lie, though not what the speaker's true belief is.  If the liar is subject to some temporary Emotion or Illusion effect which causes him to communicate something contrary to his normal beliefs, this will also be detected.  (This leaves the character in a rather confusing belief situation if they are themselves subject to the same effect, granting them an extra opportunity to shake it off if possible.)

If another Charm directly contests the effects of this one, add (character's Essence) in bonus dice to oppose the other Charm.  These dice are not included in the normal limits on dice added by Charms.

text: As Malaclypse the Younger himself said, "Even false things are true."  Fully internalising this understanding allows a Priest of Eris to conceive and to utter both truth and falsehood with equal conviction.

This Charm allows the character to make any statements while temporarily holding the firm belief that they are true, or that they are false, as preferred.  They may change their belief back and forth at will for the duration.  This affects mundane or magical attempts to discern the veracity of the character's statements, in word, writing, thought or any other medium.  If some other effect contests this Charm, add the character's Essence in automatic successes to the ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Larceny) roll.

Social combat is affected while this Charm is active, in that a character may choose to use Charisma where Manipulation would normally apply, and vice versa, at any time.

Activating this Charm allows a character to read past the expressions and words of anyone who is questioning her, letting her know exactly what to say to direct attention away from herself.  While the Charm is active, listeners suffer a penalty equal to (character's Essence) to their Dodge and Parry MDVs whenever she uses a social attack or defense to attempt to make herself seem irrelevant to a line of investigation, or innocent of some transgression.  With a suitable stunt she may even apply this penalty to attempts to shift interest to or cast suspicion on someone else.

text: Right and wrong are subjective concepts, but even the madness of the Wyld knows its own natural state.

This Charm instantly reveals to the character the type and location of any objects within (Essence x 10) yards which do not naturally belong where they are.  A weapon concealed under someone's bed, a raksha in Creation, or a nobleman wandering the poor quarter of some town, would stand out immediately.  On the other hand a letter hidden in a secret compartment of a desk (which contains various similar papers), a spy among an enemy's staff, or an assassin hiding in the shadows, might go undetected.

Mundane attempts at concealment are useless against this Charm.  If some supernatural effect contests it, roll the character's (Investigation + Essence) against the Essence of the creator of the effect.

The name of this Charm comes from the image of changes made in the Loom of Fate, but it works equally well in other sorts of reality.  Activating it allows a character to sense the degree and type of influence which beings or objects are able and likely to have, or have already had, on the world.  He will gain this knowledge for all relevant beings and objects which he can currently see (or otherwise clearly sense).

The measure of influence may be due to raw, Essence-fueled power, to some Destiny, or to mundane Backing or Influence etc.  Beings with awakened Essence of 3 or more are noticeable, as are those with a similar rating in Allies, Backing, Command, Connections, Contacts, Cult, Destiny, Face, Influence or Reputation.  The storyteller may adjust the list of applicable backgrounds.  Artifacts, manses and demesnes rated 3 or more are visible to the character.  Objects and beings lacking any of the above ratings will nevertheless be picked out if they are likely to play, or have played, a vital part in some pivotal event, e.g., an assassination.

The character will automatically know which traits or types of events make each object or being notable, but will not know trait ratings or details of events.  To gain more detailed knowledge the character may make a (Perception + Investigation) roll.  Knowing the rating of a single trait is difficulty 2, as is getting an approximate timing for past events.  Seeing some detail of specific individuals or power groups involved in Backgrounds, or of the role an object or being played in past events, is difficulty 4.  Trying to determine future events, associations or tendencies adds 2 to the difficulty; and, of course, the future may change before it becomes the present.

The name of this Charm comes from the image of gaps and holes in the Loom of Fate, but it works equally well in other sorts of reality.  Activating it allows a character to sense objects and beings which are hidden or disguised.  The true appearance of such things is not revealed, but their locations and the types of concealment are.

For hidden, invisible or immaterial things, this Charm halves any penalties to the character's interactions with them.  Stealth or similar effects which would completely prevent the character from interacting with a target instead impose a -4 external penalty.  This Charm does not in itself grant the ability to interact with immaterial beings.

Disguised things are revealed as such, including the nature of the disguise.  This Charm reveals mundane and magical disguises, including those using Lunar shapeshifting, Sidereal astrology, and any unnatural mental influences which cause the character to mistake the true nature of something.  (This does not count as resisting the unnatural mental influence directly, so does not accrue Podge.)  However, the identity of the disguised person or object remains unknown.  If the digsuise itself imposes any penalties on the character, they are halved.  Furthermore, the character may add 2 dice to any rolls (of any Ablity) to see through or undo the disguise.

text: To draw others towards confusion or understanding, as desired, it helps to know what really draws them.  The Priests of Eris have therefore learned to be particularly good at discovering what drives people.

With this Charm the Storyteller attempts to discover the target's Intimacies and Motivations.  The target may be an individual or a social group.  The character's player rolls (Perception + Investigation) against a difficulty of 1, subtracting an external penalty of (TODO [the target's Manipulation + Socialize] / 2).  Each success reveals one Intimacy; once all Intimacies are known, further successes reveal the target's Motivation (or Motivations, in rare cases).
