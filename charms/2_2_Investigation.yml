  All things are one, if seen from the right angle.  This maxim is most
  often used in dissolving the boundaries between concepts, but it can also lead
  one to the secret of capturing many observations in one instant.
  
  This Charm allows the character to instantly record a precise memory of the
  scene around them, for later Investigation rolls or other normal uses of
  memory.  The scope of the scene is at least a radius of (Essence x 5) yards,
  possibly more if there is little detail in the scene.  The memory will include
  only what the character was able to sense at that moment, though they may turn
  on the spot in order to gain a full 360-degree record.  The effect lasts as
  long as the motes remain committed, meaning that the memory could be subjected
  to several Investigation actions if time allows, or more information is gained
  from other sources.
  
  The memory is also unnaturally clear, removing one point of external penalties
  to perception, within the range of the Charm, at the point when it is
  activated.  If this Charm is used in Combos with sensory-enhancement Charms,
  or such Charms are already in effect, then later Investigation actions on the
  record are on the basis of the enhanced senses.

  TODO
  
  This Charm allows the Mirror-Bearer to go beyond concealment of evidence to
  understand how to specifically mislead observers, and to do so in a moment.
  The character makes a (Wits + Investigation) roll and, for each success,
  immediately understands one change which could be made to alter a specific
  conclusion which investigators would draw.  For example, she might see how to
  make a lock appear to have been picked rather than forced, make a footprint
  seem to be male rather than female, or even how to make an outright lie sound
  like a half-truth.  The character can choose the conclusions she would lead
  people to, though the Storyteller may veto outlandish ones.
  
  If these changes are made, by the character or anyone else, the adjustments
  will be undetectable by mundane means.  Detection by supernatural means allows
  the investigator to make the standard contested roll of the character's (Wits
  + Investigation) versus the other investigator's (Perception + Investigation).
  Making the changes takes a tenth of the time it normally would.
  
  Used in Social situations, this Charm can be used before an attack, or as part
  of one, to learn how to change a target's mind about the truth or implications
  of some statement or information.  All listeners suffer an external penalty to
  their Dodge and Parry Mental Defense Values, equal to the character's
  Investigation, against any Manipulation-based attacks the character makes
  relating to the specific conclusions covered by her (Wits + Investigation)
  roll.  This penalty lasts until the end of the given Social combat.
  
  *[TODO: Is this too powerful?  Maybe the number of "points of misdirection"
  should be half the successes, or something?]*

  TODO
  
  Constructing a personally satisfying proof using twisted and ill-founded
  logic, the Moonlight Lyre uses this Charm to defeat a social attack by
  subjecting herself to an Illusion that it is an unacceptable -- indeed,
  impossible -- order.  Resisting natural mental influence in this way costs
  only three motes, while unnatural mental influence costs twice as much.
  
  The Illusion lasts for the rest of the scene, and she cannot voluntarily
  terminate the Charm before then, nor spend Willpower to resist her own
  Illusion.  Unless some other effect removes or bypasses that Illusion, she
  cannot take any action substantially equivalent to that demanded by the attack
  until the next scene.  This Charm may therefore have undesirable consequences
  after using it to resist, for example, an Emotion of fear which drives one to
  flee, or anger which drives one to attack.  Further attacks within the scene
  which would direct the character to effectively the same course of action,
  even if for a different reason, are equally deemed impossible.  Attacks which
  try to get the character to do something different would require a separate
  activation of this Charm to resist.
  
  Although the Illusion which limits the character only lasts for the scene,
  mental influence which is defended against simply never takes hold, so the
  character need not make further efforts to resist the original attack in later
  scenes.
  
  Since this Charm involves both imposing and acceding to unnatural mental
  influence, the two sides are in balance, and the character's Hodge and Podge
  tracks are unaffected.

  As Malaclypse the Younger himself said, "Even false things are true."
  Fully internalising this understanding allows a Priest of Eris to conceive and
  to utter both truth and falsehood with equal conviction.
  
  This Charm allows the character to temporarily reverse her belief about the
  truth or falsity of a given notion.  For as long as the motes remain
  committed, she is subject to an Illusion effect which changes her own belief.
  This affects mundane or magical attempts to discern the veracity of the
  character's statements, in word, writing, thought or any other medium.
  Magical attempts to determine the truth as the character sees it will be
  fooled by the Illusion.  If such magic is strong enough to require a roll-off,
  add a bonus of Essence successes.  Effects which impose a contradictory belief
  result in a contested roll, with a bonus of (Essence ÷ 2) successes for the
  character.  This applies both to effects in play when the Charm is activated,
  and those applied while it is active.
  
  Social combat is affected while this Charm is active, in that a character will
  use Charisma where Manipulation would normally apply, or vice versa, regarding
  the particular inverted belief.
  
  Since this Charm involves both imposing and acceding to unnatural mental
  influence, the two sides are in balance, and the character's Hodge and Podge
  tracks are unaffected.  The character loses any possibility of resisting this
  Charm's Illusion by activating it, though she may still choose to terminate it
  at any time.

  To draw others towards confusion or understanding, as desired, it helps
  to know what really draws them.  The Priests of Eris have therefore learned to
  be particularly good at discovering what drives people.
  
  With this Charm the Storyteller attempts to discover the target's Intimacies
  and Motivations.  The target may be an individual or a social group.  The
  character's player rolls (Perception + Investigation) against a difficulty of
  ([the target's Manipulation + Socialize] ÷ 2).  A successsful roll reveals one
  Intimacy, which need not have been demonstrated in the current scene.  If the
  character already knows all the target's Intimacies, further successful rolls
  reveal the target's Motivation (or Motivations, in rare cases).

  As a well-known old mind-bender once said, "we leak the truth from every
  pore".  Those of the Soft and Steady Hand can seive the words and non-verbal
  cues they receive from those around them to find, if not the truth, at least
  the holes between.
  
  Activating this Charm allows the character to recognise all deliberate lies or
  half-truths he observes during the scene, whether communicated verbally or by
  facial expression etc.  In the case of a half-truth, the character can
  reflexively spend 1 mote to know which parts are believed to be a lie, though
  not what the speaker's true belief is.  If the liar is subject to some
  temporary Emotion or Illusion effect which causes him to communicate something
  contrary to his normal beliefs, this will also be detected.  (This leaves the
  character in a rather confusing belief situation if they are themselves
  subject to the same effect, granting them an extra opportunity to shake it off
  if possible.)
  
  If another Charm directly contests the effects of this one, add (character's
  Essence ÷ 2) successes to oppose the other Charm.

  Right and wrong are subjective concepts, but even the madness of the
  Wyld knows its own natural state.
  
  This Charm instantly reveals to the character the type and location of any
  objects within (Essence x 10) yards which do not naturally belong where they
  are, or are not performing their natural function.  A lothario hiding in
  temple, a raksha in Creation, or a nobleman wandering the poor quarter of some
  town, would stand out immediately.  On the other hand a letter hidden in a
  secret compartment (intended for just such a purpose), a spy among an enemy's
  staff, or an assassin hiding in the shadows, might go undetected.  What is or
  is not detectable to a character is down to the Storyteller's discretion.
  
  Mundane attempts at concealment are useless against this Charm.  If some
  supernatural effect contests it, roll the character's (Investigation +
  Essence) against the Essence of the creator of the effect.

  The name of this Charm comes from the image of changes made in the Loom of
  Fate, but it works equally well in other sorts of reality.  Activating it
  allows a character to sense the degree and type of influence which beings or
  objects have had, or are likely to have, on the world.  He will gain this
  knowledge for all relevant beings and objects which he can currently see (or
  otherwise clearly sense).
  
  The measure of influence may be due to raw, Essence-fueled power, to some
  Destiny, or to mundane influence etc.  Beings with awakened Essence of 3 or
  more are noticeable, as are those with a similar rating in relevant
  Backgrounds such as Allies, Connections, Cult, Influence and so on.  The
  storyteller may adjust the list of applicable Backgrounds.  Artifacts, manses,
  demesnes and freeholds rated 3 or more are visible to the character.  Objects
  and beings lacking any of the above ratings will nevertheless be picked out if
  they are likely to play, or have played, a vital part in some pivotal event,
  e.g., an assassination.
  
  The character will automatically know which traits or types of events make
  each object or being notable, but will not know trait ratings or details of
  events.  To gain more detailed knowledge the character may make a ([Perception
  or Intellignce] + Investigation) roll.  Knowing the rating of a single trait
  is difficulty 2, as is getting an approximate timing for past events.  Getting
  a rough idea of individuals or power groups involved in Backgrounds, or of the
  general nature of past pivotal events, is difficulty 4.  This Charm cannot
  reveal precise details, however: it might point someone out as being involved
  in an assassination, but cannot tell whether they were assassin, guard,
  witness, or intended victim.  Trying to determine the rough shape of events,
  associations, or tendencies which lie in the future, as opposed to the past or
  present, adds 2 to the difficulty.  This is, of course, subject to the
  vagaries of Fate and chance, and anything which disturbs that may change what
  comes to pass.

  Going beyond seeing the lines of possible power in the world around them, the
  Puppeteer learns to twist them to his own ends, understanding how best to
  nudge some being or object to follow the path the he desires.  When the
  character activates this Charm, he touches the target and nominates a
  particular goal, though he need not communicate it to anyone.  As long as the
  motes remain committed, applicable actions which support the goal gain
  (Essence ÷ 2) dice, whereas those which effectively oppose it suffer an
  external penalty of (Essence ÷ 2).  Actions which simply do not contribute to
  the goal do not suffer a penalty.  If the Charm targets a being, all of its
  actions are applicable.  If it targets an object, all actions which employ
  that object are applicable, regardless of who takes the actions.  Bonus dice
  count towards the acting being's limit on dice added by Charms, but the target
  may use the character's limit if it is higher.  A character can activate this
  Charm multiple times on separate targets or on a single target, possibly to
  support different goals, but the bonuses and penalties do not stack.
  Applications from multiple characters do stack, however.

  The name of this Charm comes from the image of gaps and holes in the Loom of
  Fate, but it works equally well in other sorts of reality.  Activating it
  allows a character to sense objects and beings which are hidden or disguised.
  The true appearance of such things is not revealed, but their locations and
  the types of concealment are.
  
  For hidden, invisible or immaterial things, this Charm halves any penalties to
  the character's interactions with them.  Against Stealth effects which can be
  contested by mundane means, this Charm halves the difficulty and any added
  successes when the character contests it.  Against Stealth effects which are
  impenetrable by mundane means, the character will know that a concealed being
  is present, but will not learn its location.  This Charm does not in itself
  grant the ability to interact with immaterial beings.
  
  Disguised things are revealed as such, including the nature of the disguise.
  This Charm reveals mundane and magical disguises, including those using Lunar
  shapeshifting, Sidereal astrology, and any unnatural mental influences which
  cause the character to mistake the true nature of something.  (This does not
  count as resisting the unnatural mental influence directly, so does not accrue
  Podge.)  However, the identity of the disguised person or object remains
  unknown.  If the digsuise itself imposes any penalties on the character, they
  are halved.  Furthermore, the character may add 2 dice to any rolls (of any
  Ablity) to see through or undo the disguise.  For the avoidance of doubt,
  raksha Assumption charms do not count as disguises for the purposes of this
  Charm.
