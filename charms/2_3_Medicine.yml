  Sometimes ignoring a problem is the best way to deal with it, at least
  in the short term.  Laying a hand on the target's forehad, the Exalt uses this
  Charm to remove up to (character's Essence) points of wound penalty from a
  willing target (or one who is inactive or unconscious) for the remainder of
  the scene.  The character cannot spend extra motes to move from penalties into
  bonus points.  This benefit lasts even if the target takes further damage, so
  one might pre-emptively spend 8m to allow the target to ignore all wound
  penalties for a scene.  A character who reaches Incapacitated will react as if
  only at -4 penalty, and one who reaches Dying will not die, remaining
  Incapacitated, until the Charm ends.
  
  The side-effect of ignoring these wounds, however, is that the character
  temporarily loses a number of points of Temperance equal to the penalties
  corresponding to his current health level, to a minimum of zero.

  With this Charm the Exalt encourages the body of the target away from
  the disordered state which is injury and back to the metastable pattern of
  normal health.  This Charm supplements a dramatic action to tend to wounds.
  It immediately staunches the bleeding of any wounds on the target.  For each 3
  motes spent, one lethal level of damage can be converted into a bashing level.
  Alternatively, by spending one point of Willpower the Exalt may convert
  aggravated levels into lethal, at the cost of 5 motes each.  In the latter
  case, these converted levels cannot then be converted into bashing by a
  further application of this Charm, though other Medicine effects may be
  applicable.

  This Charm allows the character to concoct some nostrum which is in fact
  ineffective, but convince a patient that it will cure.  It is the Illusion of
  this Charm, rather than the potion, which aids the target, so some attempt at
  medical theatricality is advised, including at least pretending to diagnose
  the illness.  The patient can resist the effects by spending one point of
  Willpower, though he or she is unlikely to do so unless she has some reason to
  actively distrust the Exalt's skills, or does not wish to be healed.
  
  As long as the target is subject to the Illusion, any penalties the Sickness
  would apply are reduced by (character's Essence), to a minimum of zero.
  Additionally, anyone attempting to cure the disease may use the higher of the
  Discordian's Charisma or Manipulation in place of their own rating in the
  relevant Attribute.  (Explaning why the target needs further treatment may
  require a little smooth talking but will not normally break the Illusion.)
  Similarly, the target may use that rating in place of their own Stamina when
  making a Morbidity check, treated or not.
  
  A single application of this Charm creates enough mock medicine to treat up to
  (Essence) individuals.  However, it will only work for those who were present
  when it was prepared, or who see the benefits in effect on a subject.  In
  addition, if anyone treated subsequently dies of the illness, all who witness
  it become likely to mistrust the character's skill in future and, if currently
  under the effects of this Charm, may well unconsciously spend Willpower to
  resist the Illusion.

  Most healers use observation, skill and judgement to determine the
  nature of the disease spirits affecting their patient.  Those whose healing
  power comes from Eris, however, choose to bend the reality of the illness to
  their will, confounding the spirits which generate it.  This Charm allows the
  Exalt to apply (Essence) points of reduction across the Virulence, Untreated
  Morbidity and/or Difficulty To Treat of the disease, with Treated Morbidity
  reducing by the same amount as the Untreated Morbidity.  This Charm does not
  require diagnosis of the disease before it can be used, but it does require a
  further attempt to actually treat the disease, unless the Untreated Morbidity
  is reduced to zero.  If the disease spreads from the victim before it is
  cured, any who are infected will suffer only the reduced form.  The reduced
  form can also spread to those already infected with the original disease,
  improving their chances of survival even without treatment.  In the face of
  the Great Contagion, this Charm might slightly improve one individual's
  chances, but the benefits will not spread to others.

  The doctors of Discordia cannot heal Crippling wounds as easily as the
  Solar Exalted, for instance, but they can rework the body to press some parts
  of it into service where others are lost.
  
  Applying this Charm allows the character to remove penalties from any one
  Crippling wound by moulding the patient's flesh and bones until they fill in
  the gaps.  The patient does not suffer damage from this reshaping but they
  will fall into a deep sleep, lasting for a number of days equal to the number
  of penalty levels removed.  The reshaping is imperfect, however, and leaves
  the recipient with a -1 penalty to their Appearance.
  
  Alternatively, the character may convert one kind of Crippling effect to
  another (subject to storyteller approval), e.g., replacing blindness with a
  missing limb.  In this case there is no change to Appearance, unless the
  storyteller judges that the changes merit it.
  
  These effects are permanent, unless removed by some effect which counters
  Shaping.

  Mortal healers can create curative draughts to counter most non-magical
  poisons, while some Exalted can magically purge venom from a victim's body.
  The Soft and Steady Hands, however, turn the virulence of a poison against
  itself.  This Charm allows the Exalt to adjust the nature of the inimical
  substance so that, as soon as a victim succeeds on a (Stamina + Resistance)
  roll, it begins to heal levels of damage, rather than inflict them.  The
  altered substance can only heal those levels of damage which it inflicted,
  however.  Once all such levels are healed, or the damage from all doses has
  run its course, the toxin is deemed to have been expelled from the victim's
  system, and the Shaping effect ends.  The character must keep the motes
  committed to this Charm until this happens, or the poison will revert to
  causing damate.  If the expelled poison can be collected, it can be re-used.
  
  While under the effects of this Charm, mortal victims can resist the toxin as
  if they were Exalted, while Exalted gain a bonus equal to their own Essence.
  Some Erisians have been suspected of using this Charm on themselves at the
  start of a night's drinking, allowing them to consume copious quantities with
  very few ill effects.
  
  This Charm works against straightforward infection from open wounds, but is
  sadly inapplicable against environmental damage.

  *[TODO: Insert flavor]*
  
  This Charm allows an Invader of the Faith to extend the effects of Tasty
  Poison Treatment to a single source of environmental damage, adding the
  requirement that he keep the motes committed until he is no longer at risk of
  damage.  The Shaping in this case only extends to those parts of the
  environment which come into contact with the Exalt in such a way as to damage
  him, and they revert to their original effect once the Exalt moves away.
  Thus, others cannot avoid damage from walking across hot coals simply by
  following in the target's footsteps.

  The greatest of martial artists can kill their foes with a single blow,
  but the children of Eris know that sometimes it is better, or at least easier,
  not to kill.  This Charm can enhance a character's attack such that, provided
  it inflicts at least one level of damage, the target will firmly believe
  themselves to have died.  They enter the Inactive state and will not act or
  respond to external stimulus until the Charm's effects wear off.  Observers
  with medical skill may be able to tell that the target is not actually dying
  but, unless they can determine the source of the effect, they will not know
  how to "cure" them.  If the target suffers further damage from attacks or the
  environment -- for example, if they fall into a lake and begin to drown -- the
  Charm will end early.
  
  Alternatively, the character may utter a pronunciation of doom as a
  miscellaneous or dramatic action, rather than make a physical attack.  This is
  an attempt to make the target believe that they will die at some specific
  point within the next (character's Essence) days.  This requires the target to
  be able to hear and understand the Exalt, who makes a contested ([Charisma or
  Manipulation] + Medicine) roll against the target's ([Perception or
  Intelligence] + Integrity).  Success means that the target accepts the belief
  and will suffer the above effects when the time arrives, lasting for
  (character's Essence) scenes.  It may be possible to magically disabuse them
  of this belief before that time, however.
  
  In either case, this is an unnatural mental influence which costs one
  Willpower to resist.  This Willpower must be spent either at the time of the
  attack (in the first case) or before the actual Illusion of death takes hold
  (in the second case).  After that, the target will not believe themselves to
  be capable of resisting.

  Sometimes the whim of the Discordian is to take madness away, rather
  than to bestow it.  This Charm allows the target to spend Willpower to resist
  natural or unnatural mental influence, or the effects of a Charm which can be
  resisted in that way, without gaining Limit or suffering similar side effects.
  Additionally it allows the character to pay some of the target's cost, at a
  rate of 5m per 1wp, or directly in Willpower.  The character will gain Podge
  if she contributes Willpower to this cost.
  
  A character who knows this Charm will automatically notice anyone attempting
  to resist relevant effects within (character's Essence x 10) yards of her, and
  will know if that resistance would trigger Limit Break or similar effects.  At
  such juncture she may choose to assist reflexively with this Charm, assuming
  she has not already used a different Charm in her current action.  The target
  cannot resist the help form this Charm, even if they wanted to, unless they
  are resistent to Shaping.  Characters may target themselves with this Charm.

  Since Eris created her Children outside of Creation, far away in space
  and time from the Usurpation, they have avoided the Great Curse of the Yozi.
  Furthermore, given their sensitivity to balance and imbalance, they have some
  intuitive sense of such things, even though they may not understand them
  explicitly.  A momentary flickering of orange tendrils flows between the
  character and her target when this Charm is activated, and those tendrils
  allow her to adjust the target's rating of Limit, Resonance, Clarity, Stasis
  or similar, either up or down, by the amount of Willpower she chooses to
  expend.  This Charm constitutes unnatural mental influence, so the target may
  choose to resist it at a cost of 1 Willpower, although that may in itself
  increase their Limit, for example; by the same token, the Discordian herself
  will gain a point of Hodge.
  
  If the Exalt successfully reduces the target's rating, by whatever value, the
  target will regain an equal number of points of temporary Willpower, up to
  their normal maximum.  If the target has a normal minimum, such as the Clarity
  of the Alchemicals with certain Charms installed, any reduction beyond this
  point (and corresponding Willpower gain) lasts only for one scene, after which
  it returns to that minimum.  Any of the target's Charms or other powers which
  rely on this minimum are unavailable for the duration of this Charm.
  
  A character who knows this Charm will automatically notice when anyone within
  (character's Essence x 10) yards of her is about to enter Limit Break or a
  similar state.  At such juncture she may choose to assist reflexively with
  this Charm, assuming she has not already used a different Charm in her current
  action.  This Charm is explicitly allowed in a Combo with Soul-Soothing
  Poultice.  Sadly, characters may not target themselves with this Charm.
