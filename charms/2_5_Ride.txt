text: The chaotic nature of the Steady Hand gives her an innate affinity with beasts of burden, which are never fully domesticated at heart.  A Discordian with this Charm subtracts (her permament Essence ÷ 2) from the Control rating of any mount, once astride it (which could include a death-defying leap onto the back of a Tyrant Lizard).  She will also never botch a Control roll, when one is required.  Lastly, while riding she uses all her Abilities at their full rating, regardless of her Ride rating.  Animals with at least child-level intelligence (equivalent to Familiar 3 or more) are not compelled to obey their rider, but will tend to do so unless they have reason not to and, in any event, will not throw or attack her unless she actively attacks them.

text: The life of the Priests of Eris can be lonely at times, and having a companion who is smart enough to provide entertaining company, but dim enough not to give away too many secrets can be a boon.  With this Charm, the Moonlight Lyre gives a simple mount the intelligence, communication skills and 5-mote Essence store of a Familiar 3 creature (though the Essence store starts off empty).  If the creature is already at least as intelligent as an eight- or nine-year-old child, it gains a point of Intelligence or Awareness (character's choice).  If the creature is already rated as Familiar 3 or more, it gains a point of both Intelligenceand Awareness, and can store 5 extra motes for each dot of Familiar rating above 3 (again, this extra store starts off empty).  This Charm normally lasts one scene, but may be extended indefinitely by spending 1 point of Willpower in addition to the mote cost, and keeping both motes and Willpower committed.

text: The strange and varied activities of the Discordians often call for travel at short notice.  With this Charm the Storyteller summons one of any type of living creature, including spirits and elementals, suitable for riding.  (Note that, depending on what other Charms the Exalt possesses, the definition of suitability might be quite broad.)  Creatures of only animal intelligence have no choice but to answer the summons; those of child-like or greater intelligence are under a Compulsion to come, and to allow the character to mount.  After that, the Compulsion effect of this Charm ends.

This Charm gently bends the strands of Fate to ensure that the mount arrives as quickly as possible.  If there are creatures of that type within a mile, one will arrive on the next action; if the type of creature chosen is one common in the surrounding area, it will arrive in a matter of minutes; if rarer, it may not arrive until the following scene; if unheard-of (for instance, a Tyrant Lizard in the far North) it will arrive within a day.  Creatures cannot be summoned across the boundaries between the realms of Creation, Malfeas, the Wyld etc.

Unique creatures and individuals within a type cannot be summoned, nor can those types with an Essence of 2 or more.  The exception to this is if the creature is one with whom the Exalt has previously formed a positive bond, through natural acquaintance, Charm use or other means.  In that case, the individual is not under a Compulsion to come, but is aware of the summons and can take advantage of the bending of Fate to arrive rapidly, if it chooses to answer the call.

text: In some circumstances, even the strangest of living creatures just won't cut it as a mount.  This Charm provides the same summoning, Fate-bending and Compulsion effects, but allows them to be applied to automata, the Dead, demons, and whatever strange ridable things might be conceived of in the Wyld.  Summoning across the boundaries between these realms is still impossible.  The Steady Hand can summon creatures of a type with Essence up to (her permanent Essence ÷ 2), and with this Charm they are subject to Compulsion.  However, specific individuals still cannot be compelled, only invited.  Again, any Compulsion only lasts until the rider is mounted, so further means of control, or at least negotiation, may be necessary thereafter.

text: A connection to the wild nature of mounts can be used to soothe them, as with the Instinctive Stallion Sympathy Charm; or, it can be used to bring out that wilder side.  With this Charm, an Invader of the Faith can add a creature's normal Control rating in dice (before application of effects such as that of Instinctive Stallion Sympathy) to her Join Battle roll.  The character must either be already mounted, or close enough to mount normally, in which case she also gains her seat on the mount instantly.  If battle has already been joined then, until her next action, she can multiply her mount's movement rate and jumping distance by her Ride rating, and add half her Ride rating to her (and her mount's) Dodge DV, for that action.

dep: iss, ems
text: The chaos in the soul of a Priest of Eris can inspire his mount to unnatural feats.  With this Charm, the character enables the creature he rides to travel at its normal movement rate (or a rate enhanced by other means) through one medium which could not normally traverse.  For example, a giant squid could run along the ground, a bird swim swiftly through the ocean, or a horse float through the air.  The mount and rider are able to breathe in this environment if they could not normally, though they are not protected from environmental damage (e.g., from running across lava fields, or swimming through the body of Kimbery).  The Charm does not last all that long but may be extended by repeated applications; each contiguous scene after the first, however, requires a point of Willpower in addition to the mote cost.

text: At times the Invaders of the Faith have a burning desire to really get under the skin of another being, and this Charm allows them to do exactly that.  Activating this Charm merges the being of the Exalt with that of his mount, apparently leaving only the mount standing (or flying, or swimming) there.  While the motes and willpower remain committed, the movement rates, defence values and health levels of the two are added together.  The combined being has only the natural attacks of the mount, but the character may of course set aside artifacts or other objects before merging, so that the mount or others may use them.  Artifacts attuned to the Exalt may be used by the merged being if set aside beforehand, and the Exalt may use Charms as normal.  Health levels are lost from the mount first and, if it is killed, the character is forcibly ejected from his host.  In this case, extra damage levels carry over to the character and he is automatically Stunned.  The character may end the merger at any time as a miscellaneous action.

This Charm only allows the character to possess those types of creatures affected by Pigeon-Rehoming Method.  If the mount has greater Intelligence than the animal normal, it must be willing, or else be under some form of mental influence to persuade it to accept this intimate form of riding.
