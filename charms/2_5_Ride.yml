  The chaotic nature of the Steady Hand gives her an innate affinity with
  beasts of burden, which are never fully domesticated at heart.  A Discordian
  with this Charm subtracts (Ride รท 2) from the Control rating of any mount,
  once astride it (which could include a death-defying leap onto the back of a
  Tyrant Lizard).  She will also never botch a Control roll, when one is
  required.  Lastly, while riding she uses all her Abilities at their full
  rating, regardless of her Ride rating.  Animals with at least child-level
  intelligence (equivalent to Familiar 3 or more) are not compelled to obey
  their rider, but will tend to do so unless they have reason not to and, in any
  event, will not throw or attack her unless she actively attacks them.

  The life of the Priests of Eris can be lonely at times, and having a
  companion who is smart enough to provide entertaining company, but dim enough
  not to give away too many secrets can be a boon.  With this Charm, the
  Moonlight Lyre gives a mount the intelligence, communication skills and 5-mote
  Essence store of a Familiar 3 creature (though the Essence store starts off
  empty).  If the creature is already at least as intelligent as an eight- or
  nine-year-old child, it gains a point of Intelligence or Awareness
  (character's choice).  If the creature is already rated as Familiar 3 or more,
  it gains a point of both Intelligence and Awareness, and can store 5 extra
  motes for each dot of Familiar rating above 3 (again, this extra store starts
  off empty).  The creature also gains a temporary Intimacy of friendship and
  loyalty, though the creature is not outright compelled.
  
  This Charm normally lasts one scene, but may be extended indefinitely by
  spending 1 point of Willpower in addition to the mote cost, and keeping both
  motes and Willpower committed.

  TODO
  
  This Charm involves a dramatic action in which the Soft and Steady Hand leads
  a procession around the border of an area to be protected.  The target area
  must be no greater than (Essence x 100) square miles.  The character must be
  mounted, and the procession must involve at least one other creature per 10
  square miles or part thereof.  The creatures need not be particularly
  intelligent, only have some perceptive abilities.
  
  Once the riding is complete, the warding lasts as long as the Exalt keeps the
  motes committed.  She can leave the area and still maintain the ward, but will
  not receive its insights unless she is within the boundary.  If there is a
  willing individual involved in the ride which has access to its own mote pool,
  the committment cost can be transferred to that being at any time, by spending
  a further 1wp.  In that case, both the character and the Charm's maintainer
  must be within the area for it to provide warnings.
  
  The warding works through the awareness of all species involved in the
  procession; specifically, all members of those species, whenever they are
  within the warded area.  The effect is that the character becomes instantly
  aware of anything which any individual percieves as foreign, alien or
  otherwise not belonging to the area.  The character becomes aware of the
  location of that thing, its nature (as perceived by observers) and the rough
  nature and magnitude of their concern (e.g., mild pleasure at the arrival of a
  travelling minstrel, outright terror at the appearance of a deathknight's
  army, or fatalistic acceptance when a new predator arises).
  
  Since this Charm might pick out occurrences of little interest to the
  character (e.g., a new species arriving to prey on ants), she can choose to
  ignore any particular kind of foreign creature or object, as percieved by any
  particular species after the first time she is made aware of it.  Such
  exclusions do not apply to subsequent uses of this Charm on the same
  territory.  This Charm does not by itself allow the character to "borrow" the
  senses of or use Charms via whichever creatures perceive something
  out-of-place.

  The strange and varied activities of the Discordians often call for
  travel at short notice.  With this Charm the Puppeteer summons one of any
  type of mundane creature suitable as a mount, provided it is native to the
  realm of existence in which she finds herself.  Thus in the Underworld she
  could summon a plasmic horse, in Malfeas some skittering sub-demon, or in the
  Wyld some mount-like element of her shaped surroundings.  Summoning
  elementals, spirits, demons, raksha and the like is beyond this Charm.
  
  Depending on what other Charms the Exalt possesses, the definition of
  suitability might be quite broad.  However, creatures which could
  theoretically be ridden but are not normally mounts, e.g., a Sidereal Exalt,
  are not included.  Creatures of only animal intelligence have no choice but to
  answer the summons; those of child-like or greater intelligence are under a
  Compulsion to come, and to allow the character to mount.  After that, the
  unnatural mental influence of this Charm ends.
  
  This Charm gently bends the strands of Fate (or the fabric of other realms
  than Creation) to ensure that the mount arrives as quickly as possible.  If
  there are creatures of that type within a mile, one will arrive on the next
  action; if the type of creature chosen is one common in the surrounding area,
  it will arrive in a matter of minutes; if rarer, it may not arrive until the
  following scene; if unheard-of (for instance, a Tyrant Lizard in the far
  North) it will arrive within a day.  Creatures cannot be summoned across the
  boundaries between the realms of Creation, Malfeas, the Wyld etc.; however, a
  demon steed could be summoned within Malfeas, and so on.
  
  Unique creatures and individuals within a type cannot be summoned, nor can
  those types with an Essence of 2 or more.  These constraints do not apply if
  the creature is one with whom the Exalt has previously formed a positive bond,
  through natural acquaintance, Charm use or other means.  In that case, the
  individual is not under a Compulsion to come, but is aware of the summons and
  can take advantage of the bending of Fate to arrive rapidly, if it chooses to
  answer the call and is not restrained or barred from reaching the character.
  The invitee gains a rough sense of how far away the character is (to the
  level of order of magnitude of miles), but not where.

  In some circumstances, even the strangest of mundane creatures just
  won't cut it as a mount.  This Charm upgrades its prerequisite, allowing it to
  be applied to stranger and more powerful creatures.
  
  Purchasing this Charm allows the character to summon a steed from two of the
  following categories: elementals and spirits; ghosts; demons; raksha; automata
  and other artifact mounts.  Further categories can be purchased at a cost of
  three experience points.
  
  Summoning across the boundaries between these realms is still impossible.  The
  Steady Hand can summon creatures of a type with Essence up to her (Essence -
  1), and with this Charm they are subject to Compulsion.  However, specific
  individuals still cannot be compelled, only invited.  Again, any Compulsion
  only lasts until the rider is mounted, so further means of control, or at
  least negotiation, may be necessary thereafter.

  A connection to the wild nature of mounts can be used to soothe them, as
  with the Instinctive Stallion Sympathy Charm; or, it can be used to bring out
  that wilder side.  With this Charm, an Invader of the Faith can add a
  creature's normal Control rating in dice (before application of effects such
  as that of Instinctive Stallion Sympathy) to her Join Battle roll.  The
  character must either be already mounted, or close enough to mount normally,
  in which case she also gains her seat on the mount instantly.  If battle has
  already been joined then, until her next action, she can multiply her mount's
  movement rate and jumping distance by her Ride rating, and add half her Ride
  rating to her (and her mount's) Dodge DV, for that action.

  The chaos in the soul of a Priest of Eris can inspire his mount to
  unnatural feats.  With this Charm, the character enables the creature he rides
  to travel at its normal movement rate (or a rate enhanced by other means)
  through one medium which it could not normally traverse.  For example, a giant
  squid could run along the ground, a bird swim swiftly through the ocean, or a
  horse float through the air.  The mount and rider are able to breathe in this
  environment if they could not normally, though they are not protected from
  environmental damage (e.g., from running across lava fields, or swimming
  through the body of Kimbery).  The Charm's duration may be extended by
  repeated applications.
  
  [TODO: This is probably too cheap, has too few prereqs and/or has min Ess too
  low, as compared with SHFA.]

  At times the Heart-Strung have a burning desire to really get under the
  skin of another being, and this Charm allows them to do exactly that.
  Activating this Charm merges the being and equipment of the Exalt with that of
  a willing mount, apparently leaving only the mount standing (or flying, or
  swimming) there.  Activation of the Charm produces an Obvious change, but the
  merged being does not show an Obvious magical effect.
  
  While the motes and willpower remain committed, the combined entity uses the
  higher of the two ratings when calculating dice pools and Static Values for
  Strength, Dexterity, Stamina, Perception, and Wits, and for values calculated
  from these (such as movement rates and defence values).  For Charisma,
  Manipulation and Appearance use the mount's rating, and for Intelligence the
  character's.  For Abilities use the higher rating, provided actions are
  possible for the mount to carry out, given its form.  Abilities are capped at
  the character's Ride rating, unless he knows Instinctive Stallion Sympathy.
  The merged form is limited to the communication abilities of the mount, unless
  Charms are applied, although most mounts should be capable of scratching at
  least basic writing into the ground, or similar.  The storyteller may apply
  penalties to actions as appropriate.
  
  The character's equipment is physically inaccessible but any items with
  magical properties can still be used, provided they do not depend on their
  physical form.  Thus the benefits and powers of most artifact armor and
  weaponry are inapplicable, but those of hearthstones and other artifacts are
  in many cases still usable.
  
  The character can give the mount a general instruction ("flee", "attack those
  people", etc.) and leave it to operate on its own, or he can specifically
  direct it on a given action.  If the mount is under general instruction, the
  character can take his own actions as normal, as if he were riding the mount,
  provided they do not require his normal physical form or that of his
  equipment, nor interfere with the physical action the mount is taking.  For
  example, actions to observe and assess the situation, or to activate magical
  powers, may be possible.  Shaping or casting sorcery is only possible if the
  mount is unmoving, that is, inactive or taking a guard action.  If the
  character is specifically directing the mount's action, that counts as his
  action.  To both cause his mount to make a specific attack, and use an attack
  of his own on the same action, he must make a flurry.
  
  The combined being has only the natural attacks of the mount, but the
  character may of course set aside artifacts or other objects before merging,
  so that the mount or others may use them.  Artifacts attuned to the Exalt may
  be used by the merged being if set aside beforehand, provided it can wield or
  wear them.  If the mount has access to magical powers, the possessing
  character cannot activate them himself, but he can cause the mount to spend
  the necessary motes, Willpower and so on, to activate them on his behalf.
  Health levels are lost from the mount first and, if it is killed, the
  character is forcibly ejected from his host.  In this case, extra damage
  levels carry over to the character and he is automatically Stunned.  The
  character may end the merger at any time as a miscellaneous action.
  
  By default this Charm only allows the character to possess those types of
  creatures affected by Pigeon-Rehoming Method.  At Ride 5, its scope extends to
  all beings affected by Horseshoe Affinity Lure, costing an additional number
  of motes equal to the target's (Essence x 2), or (Artifact rating x 2) for
  automata or other artifact mounts.  If the mount has greater Intelligence than
  the animal normal, it must be willing, or else be under some form of mental
  influence to persuade it to accept this intimate form of riding.  Automata and
  artifact mounts can only be possessed if they are not attuned to another
  character, and some may require the character to attune them before they can
  be activated.
