As long as motes remain committed to this Charm, the character can copy existing messages at (her Essence x 100) times her normal rate.  However, the copies are imperfect, with (Essence) words in 100 being transcribed incorrectly, to a minimum of (Essence) words.  Each copy made with a given activation of this Charm will have exactly the same mistakes.  Quite what those mistakes are is left to the storyteller.

If the character must translate the message from one language to another, she works at only (her Essence x 10) times normal speed.  If she wishes to write down her own thoughts, or thoughts placed in her head by others, she can do so at (Essence x 5) times normal.  The error rate remains the same in either case.  However, she gains no speed benefit when writing down speech as she hears it.  At Essence 3, the character can write copies without a supply of ink, though she still needs a brush, quill or similar.

For the duration of this Charm, all intelligent beings who can see the Offendi can understand his meaning, as conveyed through posture and gesture, without the need for a common language.  Sufficiently intelligent animals will be clear about his meaning, as far as they are able to understand the concepts.  Beings who cannot see the character can understand him if he touches them.

By default, this Charm does not enable the character to understand others, only to convey his messages to them.  He can extend the effect to other "speakers" ata cost of 2 motes each, up to a maximum of (Essence) individuals, including himself.

text: The Rambling Minstrels add their own magical spin to the simple act of confusing someone with a well-placed word, uttering a short phrase which almost makes sense, but doesn't quite.  This Charm requires a contested roll of the character's ([Manipulation or Wits] + Linguistics), adding her permanent Essence score in automatic successes, against the target's (Wits + Integrity).  Each carry-over success delays the target's current action (if the Discordian character is defending) or next action (if attacking) by one tick, while he tries to stop thinking about the "mondo" phrase and shake off the sudden sense of utter confusion.

This Charm constitutes unnatural mental influence and may be resisted as such.  Using this Charm gains the character a point of Hodge.

text: Whether in courtly settings or street confrontations, most debates hinge on the persuasiveness or deceit of the speakers.  In a pinch, however, the best way to fend off intense negativity may be to utterly confuse one's opponent.  Taking a stance with a strange mixture of aggression and sensuality, and waving his arms in a psuedo-arcane fashion, the character shouts some nonsense phrase, such as the well-known Turkey Curse: "Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble!"

This Charm perfectly defends against any social attack which is not unexpected, even if the attack is unblockable.  However, as a special Flaw of Invulnerability, it removes the attacker as a valid target for social attacks by the character until his MDV refreshes twice.

By spending a point of Willpower, the Offendi can apply the defence of this Charm to another character, provided he is aware of the attack, and the attacker can perceive him.  He will normally be aware of the attack provided he can perceive both attacker and target, and the target is aware of the attack, since the targets reactions will show that he or she is under attack.  Some effects may prevent this; for example, the Solar Charm Hypnotic Tongue Technique specifically makes the target unaware of its effects unless he or she pays Willpower.

text: "Out of chaos comes order," a wise man said more than once.  The Knights of Five are able to transmit their orders along many channels at once, weaving words and symbols in seemingly-random strands which nonetheless converge on their intended targets.

This Charm provides a magical flurry of between two and (Essence) spoken or written actions, with a DV or MDV penalty equal to the highest penalty for any one attack.  Each action may be directed at any valid target, including the same target more than once.  The actions may also be used to Signal units in war, though target units are not themselves granted extra actions: they may receive multiple messages, but act at a normal pace.

Targeted on a single conversation, this Charm allows the Taskmaster to manipulate each participants messages to others.  The character must be able to see, hear or otherwise perceive all speakers (depending on the medium) and understand them.  Magical eavesdropping is applicable, and there is no distance limit beyond that of the character's (possibly enhanced) senses.  The player rolls (Manipulation + Linguistics) and the number of successes determines the degree of control over the conversation.  A single success allows alteration of minor details; three or more successes mean important details can be changed; and five or more successes allow complete control over the exchange.

If a given participant makes a social attack against others, the character replaces the target's dice pool with his own (Manipulation + [Performance or Presence as appropriate]), and may do anything he could normally do with such an attack, or refrain from attacking.  If the Social attack involves magic, the character must pay a surcharge of 5 motes or 1 willpower to override it, and cannot override attacks which are unblockable or undodgeable.  The character cannot initiate attacks of his own, unless he is joined in debate with the rest.

In mass combat, this Charm allows the character to control messages sent between units with a Signal action, or orders sent within a single unit via relays.  Only one or the other mode may be used on a given activation.  Coded messages between units cannot be changed to something else unless the character knows the code, but they can be rendered meaningless.

This Charm may be activated up to (Essence - 1) times concurrently, either to influence several different conversations, or to control different communcation channels in the same conversation: spoken, written, visual, or even olfactory and tactile methods.

If the character spends only motes on the Charm, then each participant may make a reflexive (Perception + Awareness) roll, with a difficulty equal to the character's Essence, to realise that their communcation is being interfered with.  If they do, they are free to use some other means to point out the deception, provided that channel has not also been compromised.  Spending one point of Willpower in addition gives the Charm the Illusion keyword, and requires the targets to spend one point of Willpower before they can make a roll.  Regardless of how many participants spend Willpower to resist, the character will gain at most one point of Podge per activation of this Charm.

This Charm allows an Apple-Corpsman to conceal a short message (about 100 words) within the subtle arrangement of objects, lighting, ambient sounds or other such structures.  The message can only be understood by its intended target, which may be an individual or some set of beings identified by their inherent nature.  So, for example, "all mortal men" or "all Dragon-Blooded born on the Blessed Isle" would be valid targets, but "my father's killer" or "all men who live within 100 miles" would not.  Holding a particular Exaltation is considered part of a being's nature, for this purpose.  Other beings will fail to see the message without some appropriate magic, even if it is pointed out to them, or to understand it, even if they can see it.

The message may be formed from portable items or written onto fixed surfaces.  Insofar as he is able, the character may carve, mark or otherwise change objects to form his message, rather than rely on placement alone.  There is no limit to the area which can be affected by this Charm, but the character must keep the motes comitted while he writes the message, which may take days over a large area.  Also, a being must be able to see the whole area at once, to receive the message, and messages written across larger areas will fade more quickly.  This Charm allows the message to survive gentle movements and natural wear and tear for up to (Essence x 10) years, but significant changes such as flood, fire or simply painting over a wall will obscure a proportionate amount of the message.  Of course, the character may re-apply the Charm later.

The message may contain mental influence, but the recipient percieves the message clearly, so it is not inherently unexpected.  The recipient need not share a common language with the author, since the communcation is sub-verbal.

[TODO: Not sure about "Ess x 10 years".  Maybe upgrade duration at higher Essence?]
