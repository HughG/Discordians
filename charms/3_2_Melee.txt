[TODO: Review once Ink Monkeys have finished playing around with Martial-ready stuff.]

This Charm summons the Erisian's Melee weapon to his hand, from any point up to (Essence x 2) yards away.  The weapon must be one which the character owns.  It travels via Elsewhere, meaning that most bindings, even magical ones, will not prevent it from returning to his hand.  The character may use this Charm to reflexively ready a weapon and attack in the same action.

A second purchase at Melee 3 and Essence 3 allows the character to use the Charm with an Indefinite duration, suspending a weapon in Elsewhere.  It will remain there as long as the motes remain committed.  When they are reflexively released, it will appear in his hand, or falls to his feet if both hands are occupied.

text: An Apple Corpsman may choose to attack directly, but is just as likely to approach in unexpected ways, to cause maximum confusion.  His powers allow him to draw the mystery of Elsewhere over the edge or point of his weapon, causing it to appear instead a short distance away, at a spot which will do the most damage to his target.

This Charm supplements a Melee attack in a number of ways.  It applies a -1 external penalty to the defender's DVs, unless he or she can somehow see into Elsewhere.  It causes the attack to ignore any Hardness or soak due to armour or any similar protections beyond the target's own skin, and to ignore DV bonuses due to cover.  It does not cause the attack to ignore natural soak, or soak added by Charms.  It furthermore effectively allows attacks to pass through solid objects, though some magical wards may prevent this.  If the character cannot otherwise percieve the target through any such objects, the attack will suffer an external penalty as severe as blindness (-4), unless some other effect improves the situation.  The target must still be in melee range, though the weapon gains the Reach tag if it did not have it already.

This Charm extends the power of its prerequisite, causing the Corpswoman's entire weapon to slide briefly sideways via Elsewhere and strike her intended target from an unpredictable angle: from behind, below, above, or perhaps just from the other hand.  The attack becomes unexpected unless the target succeeds on a (Wits + Awareness) roll at a difficulty of the character's Essence.  With appropriate stunts, the character may attempt to make the attack appear to originate from another nearby being.  The target must still be in melee range, though the weapon gains the Reach tag if it did not have it already.

Activating this Charm, the Apple Corpsman reflexively grabs a nearby object and employs it as an improvised melee weapon, with normal ratings for whatever kind of weapon can be described as most appropriate.  Clubs, staves and sledges are the most likely equivalents.  For the last, the character can use any sufficiently large item which he can lift with a feat of Strength.  In general, any kind of weapon can be improvised, if suitable scenery can be found.

Unattuned artifact weapons can be used but this raises the Charm's cost to 5 motes, and requires a feat of Strength with a difficulty equal to twice the Strength minimum required to wield them when attuned.  The character gains no magical material bonuses for this but, if he wields the weapon continuously for the scene, he may choose to immediately attune it at the end of the scene, paying the appropriate cost.

If the character is disarmed, he can reflexively pay 1 mote to re-activate this Charm for another weapon, which is immediately readied, provided one is within reach.

Concentrating for just a fraction of a second, the Overseer imposes her own understanding of reality on the space between her hands, conjuring a melee weapon of his choice out of a confluence of Erisian elemental Essence.  If she is a member of the 3rd Division and has changed her anima to a Dragon-Blooded element, she may instead choose to use the element of that anima.  The weapon is treated as a perfect example of its kind, and provides further benefits depending on the element.  Orange allows the character to reflexively spend 1 mote at Step 7 of any successful attack to convert 4 levels of bashing damage, or 2 levels of lethal damage, into 1 level of aggravated damage.  (No more than 1 level of aggravated damage can be gained in this way.)  Sweet allows the character to reduce the final number of levels of damage suffered by the target by up to (Essence), with the character regaining half that many motes, or a single point of Willpower.  (This is limited by the number of Health Levels the target has remaining: if an attack would cause 10 levels of lethal damage, and the target has only 2 levels remaining, then the character can gain at most a single mote, doing no damage to the target.  Also, this effect is appiled after all other effects which might reduce the damage the target would suffer.)  Boom produces a thunderous noise on a successful attack, and forces the target to check for Knockdown with a difficulty of 4; or, if the attack would already have forced a check for Knockdown, it adds the character's (Essence) to the difficulty.  Pungent relases a puff of unpleasant and overwhelming scent on impact, which requires the target to make a reflexive (Stamina + Resistance) roll or suffer a -2 penalty on all actions for the next (Essence) actions, as a Poison effect.  Prickle inflicts a distracting itching sensation, whose location seems to continually move, adding 1 to the Speed of the target's next (Essence) actions, as a Crippling effect.  Dirt gets into the target's eyes, adding a -2 external penalty to all actions requiring sight, for the next (Essence) actions, as a Crippling effect.  Focus makes the target temporary unwilling to divert from her current course, requiring them to fail a COnviction roll or suppress that Virtue each time they want to attack a different target, or to stop attacking, until the end of the scene.  Dream sends the target into partial reverie for the next (Essence) actions, applying a -2 external penalty to their MDVs.  Binding removes 2 points of external penalty from attempts to disarm a target.

For the normal elements of Creation, apply the benefits of the Dragon-Blooded Charm Dragon-Graced Weapon.  At the conclusion of the Charm the weapon vanishes in a burst of elementally-aspected Essence.

If the character attempts to parry an attack and succeeds (including the use of perfect defenses), she may activate this Charm to cause the attack to be re-rolled against any other valid target.  If she fails to parry it, and it is not unblockable, she may pay 5 motes to activate this Charm.  If the Charm is activated and there are no other valid targets, the attack fails altogether.

The attacker may ignore the unnatural mental influence of this Charm by spending a point of temporary Willpower.

text: By surrendering his will to whims beyond Fate, the Tower-Builder renders himself unassailable with a careless sweep of his weapon.  His apparently wild and artless swing nonetheless happens to end up at the exactly the right spot to deflect an impending blow.

This Charm allows the Discordian to perfectly defend against any attack, even if it is unblockable.  Furthermore, by spending 1 point of Willpower, the character can send the bulk of his weapon through a twist in Elsewhere, to apply a perfect Defend Other action on any being within Dash range who would be a valid target for a Melee attack by him.  The character does not actually have to dash to the being he wishes to defend, in this case.  This Charm suffers from one of the Discordian Flows of Invulnerability

text: The Children of Eris rail against strictures and structures which offend them, including the rules of space which prevent all things existing at one point.  Casting a net of Elsewhere strands across her blade, she causes slices of it to appear in several places at once as she strikes.

This Charm provides the Exalt with a magical flurry of two or more Melee-based attacks.  Each attack costs 3 motes, including the first, and the character may make a number of attacks up to (her permanent Essence), regardless of the weapon's Rate.  The Charm allows her to make these attacks without multiple action penalties and with a DV penalty equal to the highest penalty for any one attack.  The Speed of the combined actions is one more than the Speed of the longest single action.  For weapons with a Rate less than 1, the character must spend one (or more) of her extra actions realigning the momentum of the weapon after each attack.

At Essence 3, the character may additionally spend 1 point of Willpower to add an unpredictable shift to her own physical presence, allowing her to ignore all DV penalties from these attacks (but not from other sources).

[NOTE: For review, this mirrors Feathers and Fins Attack in Archery.]
