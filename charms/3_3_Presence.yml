  When activating any Charm or Combo which applies unnatural mental influence to
  its target, the character can pay an additional point of Willpower to remove
  the unnatural quality, though any specific keywords remain.  Doing this allows
  the character to reduce her Hodge rating by one point, to a minimum of zero,
  regardless of whether or not the target expends Willpower to reduce the
  natural mental influence.

  This Charm supplements a Presence-based social attack to cause its targets to
  believe that the Overseer has a certain level of authority, making it
  undodgeable and adding his Essence in automatic successes.  Note that this
  Charm does not involve unnatural mental influence.
  
  The attack targets all who can perceive him, even if they do not share a
  common language.  The authority is asserted in relation to personal power and
  skill, rather than any formal hierarchy.  Thus, he may claim to be a seasoned
  general, but not to currently command a specific force.  Also, the Charm does
  not convey any particular identity, so attempts to impersonate someone may
  require further disguise.  At the end of the scene, affected targets are free
  to change their mind about the character but they will not necessarily do so
  unless he acts out of line with his purported authority.
  
  His position can be defined in relation to those present and to any other
  individuals he mentions, assuming the targets have a sense of those
  individuals' authority.  He need not claim greater authority: he may make
  himself out to be the underdog, or create confusion and suspicion by
  positioning himself inconsistently with respect to different figures,
  suggesting that there are other strands of leadership in effect besides the
  obvious ones.

  This Charm allows the Erisian to exchange his current air of personal
  authority with that of its target.  If the target is unwilling, the character
  must treat this Charm as an undodgeable Presence-based social attack (which
  still requires touch).  If the attack succeeds, or the target was willing in
  the first place, both parties radiate an Illusion effect which causes those
  who encounter them to treat them as if each had the personal authority of the
  other.  Witnesses will tend to follow instructions and believe statements of
  prowess accordingly, noting that the authority is in personal terms, rather
  than that of a formal hierarchy.  The exchanged authority is based on what
  onlookers knew or sensed about the two affected parties at the time the Charm
  was activated, which may or may not have been a reflection of their true
  status.  This illusion may be resisted for a scene by spending a point of
  Willpower, and an observer who spends three points is no longer subject to the
  illusion for that Charm activation.  Since this Charm's duration may be longer
  than a single scene, the character may gain more than one point of Hodge over
  its course, from witnesses resisting the Illusion.
  
  Separately from the Illusion effect, the two have their Presence ratings and
  specialties exchanged for the purpose of any dice rolls, though not for other
  purposes such as Charm minimums.  In addition, the target may use any of the
  character's Presence Excellencies, if he or she is able to use Charms.  This
  aspect of the Charm is a Shaping effect.

  When this Charm is activated, all creatures who can perceive the Erisian
  Knight find his presence so overwhelming and intrusive that they find it
  difficult to ignore him.  The character rolls (an appropriate Social Attribute
  + Presence) and compares it to the MDV of each onlooker.  Any whose MDV is
  exceeded by this total suffer a natural mental influence which applies a -2
  external penalty to all actions whose focus does not include the character,
  for the duration of the Charm.  Targets will instinctively realise that it
  will be easier to interact with the character than to ignore him.  However, if
  a target succeeds at an action which excludes the character, the penalty drops
  to -1.  This Charm may be used in both combat and social situations.

  The first step to winning is not to be defeated, and sometimes the best
  defense is to give no offense.  This Charm supplements a Presence-based social
  attack targeting up to (Essence x 5) individuals joined in battle or debate or
  about to join or, in mass combat, the leader of a unit with Magnitude up to
  the Erisian's Essence.  The roll is an attempt to persuade the participants
  that battle (or social conflict) is not a good idea after all, at least for
  the moment.  Each target or unit which is successfully affected is persuaded
  to refrain from attacking.  The effect lasts for the rest of the scene, or
  until any affected individual or unit makes another Join Battle, Join War or
  Join Debate roll.  If a target has been wounded in an exchange already, from
  the character or others who are clearly his allies, they gain a number bonus
  dice to defend against the attack equal to the number of Health levels or (for
  social units) Loyalty points lost so far.  The target individual or unit
  leader must be able to hear or see the character for this Charm to work,
  though they do not need to share a language.
  
  The initial effect is an unnatural mental influence of Compulsion and may be
  resisted by spending a point of temporary Willpower.  Any compelled character
  or unit who breaks the truce is subject to a further Emotion effect of shame
  at their betrayal, inflicting a -2 internal penalty for the rest of the scene,
  which costs a further 2 Willpower to resist.  Spending Willpower to resist
  both of these effects exempts a character from any further invocations of this
  Charm in the scene.  Any character or unit who is attacked, whether by another
  affected by this Charm or by a third party, is immediately released from the
  Charm's effects.
  
  Depending on how the character handles the parley, the opponent(s) may not
  realise they were under the effects of a Charm when the scene ends, and may or
  may not choose to continue with hostilities.  If the Discordian side simply
  decides to flee, they gain a head start: automatic successes on the first of
  any contested Tracking/Evasion rolls, equal to the character's Essence,
  reducing by one on each subsequent roll, down to 0.

  This Charm exerts unnatural mental influence to exchange one of the
  Discordian's Intimacies with one from her target.  The target may spend three
  points of Willpower to resist the effects of the Charm at the time it is
  invoked.  Otherwise, the character chooses an Intimacy of her own to pass to
  the target, and a known Intimatcy from the target to take for herself.  If the
  character has not already identified any of the target's Intimacies, or wishes
  to leave the selection to chance, the Storyteller chooses one for her to gain.
  
  When the character releases her mote commitment, the Intimacies immediately
  revert to their original holders.  In the meantime, however, each character
  may work to strengthen or weaken the exchanged Intimacy.  If either Intimacy
  is lost, the Charm's effect continues, and the character (or Storyteller) may
  choose a different Intimacy to replace it and be swapped back when the Charm
  ends.  If both are lost, the Charm ends immediately and no further Intimacies
  are exchanged.

  This Charm allows the Discordian to create a physical duplicate of herself.
  It may be activated multiple times to create further duplicates, but no more
  than (Essence) may be maintained at once.  Each duplicate is based on a single
  Intimacy, adopting it as the focus of its Motivation and effectively removing
  it from the character.  If and when the duplicate ceases to exist, the
  character regains the Intimacy.  In the mean time, that Intimacy still counts
  towards the maximum number she can have herself.  The duplicate can have no
  Intimacies of its own, being single-minded in its point of view.
  
  A character's duplciates are essentially mortal, with a permanent Essence
  rating of 1 and no mote pool.  They have their own Health tracks and Virtue
  channels, but all share one Willpower pool with the character.  They may draw
  on her Charms and mote pool, but only for actions which are in support of
  their Motivation.  If a duplicate does so, it counts as the original
  character's Charm use for that action, though the character may veto this use.
  Similarly, they may take Numerology actions in support of their Motivation,
  but doing so prevents the character from using Numerology in the same action.
  The character may also veto attempts by the duplicates to spend from her
  Willpower pool.  The copies are not under the character's control, other than
  by persuasion, and may act against her wishes in support of their drive.
  
  The Discordian and her duplicates can take a miscellaceous action to share
  awareness for one scene, each continually able to know what the others are
  perceiving, thinking and doing.  This spreading of identity imposes a -1
  internal penalty on all actions.  The duplicates cannot share any magical
  equipment, although the Charm will copy mundane items carried on the
  character's person when it is activated.  Equipment is imperfectly copied, so
  stamped coins, scrip and so on will be worthless, and perfect mundane
  equipment becomes at best excellent.
  
  If a duplicate is killed, or subject to an effect which undoes Shaping, it
  instantly disappears and the character loses that Intimacy.  When the
  character releases her committment of motes, the duplicate disappears
  instantly, along with any equipment produced when creating it.

  A Discordian uses this Charm to adjust her bearing and demeanor to put herself
  beneath the notice of others.  Attempts to perceive her among a large number
  of people suffer a -4 external penalty, and even in a gathering of 5-20 people
  a -2 penalty applies.  Below that number, a -2 penalty applies only if the
  character makes an effort to stay in the background and not engage with
  anyone.  If she takes any action which draws attention to herself, including
  use of any Obvious Charms, the effect ends.  If someone notices her and draws
  attention to her, the penalty is halved but the effect does not end.
  
  Afterwards observers will be uncertain about whether the character was present
  unless they succeed on a single (Wits + Occult) roll, at a difficulty equal to
  the Exalt's Essence.  This is a side-effect of the character's Recumbent
  Destiny, rather than unnatural mental influence, and applies regardless of
  whether that Destiny is active or suppressed.

  This Charm adds to the benefits which the character can gain from his stunts
  for the rest of the scene.  Activating the Charm gives the character an
  initially empty 10-mote Overdrive pool.  Any successful stunt which the
  Storyteller judges to be sufficiently Discordian (i.e., surprising or
  confusing) adds one mote to this pool, in addition to its normal benefits.

  This Charm benefits any action in which the character co-ordinates her efforts
  with others.  She need not lead the action, and it need not be a
  Presence-based action.  The action may be covered under the teamwork rules
  (Exalted Core, p. 125) or it may be a coordinated attack (Exalted Core,
  p. 144).  For teamwork actions where all charcters can apply their full
  effort, it adds one die per participant, to a maximum of (Presence + Essence).
  For actions where additional participants can contribute only partially, it
  adds one bonus die per participant with at least a single dot in the relevant
  Ability (giving two bonus per such participant in total), and the maximum
  numer of dice increases to (leader's Ability + character's Presence).  For
  co-ordinated attacks, it reduces the difficulty of the action by the
  character's Presence rating, to a minimum of 1, and allows the roll to be
  (Charisma + Presence) or (Charisma + War).  This Charm is explicitly permitted
  to be used in Combos with Charms from other Abilities.
