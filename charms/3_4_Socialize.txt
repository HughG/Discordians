Social actions in combat time (compare with Lunar follow-ups to Charismatic
Lunar Trick).

text: TODO

Understanding social norms & desires.  Compare with existing charms about
perceiving patterns, and things out of place.  Maybe something to identify
individuals who could be persuaded to disrupt or oppose the norm?


name: fm, Flashmob!

text: TODO

Flashmob!  A bit like "Gathering the Congregation", but only scene-long, and
the character doesn't have to lead the group or even do anything observable to
guide it.  The group just follows his intention.

Cult-building (possibly temporary).  Compare with Perf Charm "Subtle Heresy
Foundation" (which isn't really that Perf-y, since it doesn't involve standing
up and performing ... hmm ...).

Subverting social norms.  Something to create an Intimacy/Loyalty which the
person will hold but only act on covertly, or not in the presence of
outsiders.

[TODO: Should possibly have higher mins.  Compare with Lunar "Social Unit
Charms".  Should possibly simplify effects a bit.]

Using this Charm, the Overseer protects a specific loyalty (Intimacy) within
the Policy of a social group.  The character must have spent several hours
over the previous month interacting with the group, though not necessarily in
an obvious way.  Activating the Charm in the presence of at least one member
of the group, the character causes a sub-group of Magnitude up to (character's
Essence) to gain a further Intimacy to protecting the chosen loyalty.

Any time a group Leader's Loyalty pool is reduced to zero and he implements
some action contrary to the loyalty, causing some of the group to split off,
two effects come into play.  First, some of the affected members will remain
in both the original and split-off group, and work to re-join the two parts in
subsequent scenes, and likely undo the implemented action as far as possible.
Secondly, those in the main group work against this foreign influence from
within, imposing an internal penalty of (Essence ÷ 2) on the implementation
of the action.

Additionally, if any effect attempts to remove or weaken the protected
loyalty, or impose another which is contradictory, the internal opposition
helps the Leader resist this.  Assuming Loyalty can be spent to resist the
effect, the amount of Loyalty to resist for a single scene is halved, to a
minimum of one, and the total amount of Loyalty the Leader must spend to shake
it off is reduced by the character's Essence.  If the Leader cannot validly
resist the effect, the group automatically loses a dot of Magnitude as the
innoculated members, in a last-ditch attempt to protect their loyalty, all
leave at once to form a new group.

Illusion to persuade people that a certain course of action is neutral or
positive in terms of their Intimacies/Policy, when in fact it's negative.

Disrupting intentions.  Maybe like (or a variant of) the above, but persuade
people *not* to do something (and possibly do something else), even though
it's in support of their Policy.


name: nssl, Non-Social*Scene-long
dep: 

text: TODO

Scene-long non-Social action which influences Social combat/actions.  (Idea
from visual priming of creativity.)


name: nsai, Non-Social*affecting Intimacies
dep: nssl

text: TODO

Follow on to previous one: Non-social-interaction actions to indirectly affect
Intimacies and actions.  E.g., something small which triggers a poor harvest
or price increase, which then triggers the specific desired response from a
social group.  (Basically, a disguised long-term social action.)
