Using this Charm, the Overseer protects a specific loyalty (Intimacy) within
the Policy of a social group.  The character must have spent several hours
over the previous month interacting with the group, though not necessarily in
an obvious way.  Activating the Charm in the presence of at least one member
of the group, the character causes a sub-group of Magnitude up to (character's
Essence) to gain a further Intimacy to protecting the chosen loyalty.

Any time a group Leader's Loyalty pool is reduced to zero and he implements
some action contrary to the loyalty, causing some of the group to split off,
two effects come into play.  First, some of the affected members will remain
in both the original and split-off group, and work to re-join the two parts in
subsequent scenes, and likely undo the implemented action as far as possible.
Secondly, those in the main group work against this foreign influence from
within, imposing an internal penalty of (Essence ÷ 2) on the implementation
of the action.

Additionally, if any effect attempts to remove or weaken the protected
loyalty, or impose another which is contradictory, the internal opposition
helps the Leader resist this.  Assuming Loyalty can be spent to resist the
effect, the amount of Loyalty to resist for a single scene is halved, to a
minimum of one, and the total amount of Loyalty the Leader must spend to shake
it off is reduced by the character's Essence.  If the Leader cannot validly
resist the effect, the group automatically loses a dot of Magnitude as the
innoculated members, in a last-ditch attempt to protect their loyalty, all
leave at once to form a new group.
