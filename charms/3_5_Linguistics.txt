text: The Rambling Minstrels add their own magical spin to the simple act of confusing someone with a well-placed word, uttering a short phrase which almost makes sense, but doesn't quite.  This Charm requires a contested roll of the character's ([Manipulation or Wits] + Linguistics), adding her permanent Essence score in automatic successes, against the target's (Wits + Integrity).  Each success over the default difficulty of 3 delays the target's current action (if the Discordian character is defending) or next action (if attacking) by one tick, while he tries to stop thinking about the "mondo" phrase and shake off the sudden sense of utter confusion.

This Charm constitutes unnatural mental influence and may be resisted as such.  Using this Charm gains the character a point of Hodge.
