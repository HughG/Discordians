text: The phrase, "I didn't do it!", is a blunt and blatant excuse which captures the essence of all excuses, and with just the right amount of charm it can be made to work.  By activating this particular Charm, the Unhinged are able to prevent a counterattack taking place.  This is not a defence against the attack, rather it removes the character as a valid target for a counterattack.  Thus the attacker will not waste any motes or other expenditure on their counterattack.  Also, it means that this Charm avoids perfect attacks made as part of a counterattack.

text: Those who throw themselves at the Foolish Sages may find themselves the greater fools.  A character may employ this Charm whenever he uses his Dodge DV against an attack, successfully or not, provided the opponent is within touching distance.  This is assumed to be true unless the attack was ranged, or used a weapon with the "R" (Reach) tag.  A momentary magical redistribution of forces gives the attacker a penalty on his attack roll (but not damage roll) and Dodge DV for his next action, equal to the character's Essence.

text: Surely, those who bring true understanding of the nature of things should not be hated, but loved?  This Charm convinces an attacker, at least on an unconscious level, that the Priestess of Eris is not worthy of their ire; but, there being a need for balance in all things, someone else has to take the fall.  If the character attempts to Dodge an attack and fails, she may activate this Charm to cause the attack to be re-rolled against any other valid target.  If there are no other valid targets, the attack fails altogether, unless it is undodgeable.  The attacker may ignore the unnatural mental influence of this Charm by spending a point of temporary Willpower.

dur: Instant
dep: hpf
text: Rather than bother attempting to convince his enemy of his righteousness, a powerful Discordian will simply convince the fabric of reality to believe him.  This Charm rearranges the moment to provide a dodge which perfectly defends against any attack, even if it is undodgeable.  This Charm has one of the Four Flaws of Invulnerability.


name: samt, Smoke and Mirrors Technique
cost: 3m
mins: Dodge 3, Ess 3
type: Reflexive (Step 2)
key: Combo-OK, Illusion, Obvious
dur: Until next action
dep: exc, aci
text: Not everything can be done with smoke and mirrors, but they come in handy in a pinch.  With this Charm, the Foolish Sage appears to split into a number of smoky, slightly translucent copies of himself, equal to (his permanent Essence).  The attacker must roll his (Perception + [attack Ability]) against the character's ([Manipulation or Wits] + Dodge) at Step 10 of the attack.  Failure means that she struck one of the smoky duplicates instead, which immediately vanishes.  For a flurry or multiple attack sequence, or for multiple attackers, each action requires a separate roll to succeed, and will eliminate a separate duplicate if it fails.

At any point the attacker may spend a point of Willpower to ignore the Illusion, after which no further rolls are required.  Similarly, if all the duplicates are destroyed by multiple attacks, subsequent attacks proceed as normal.  At the start of the character's next action, the duplicates disappear.

Perfect attacks against a single target are affected by this Charm -- the attacker may perfectly hit the wrong target, depending on the roll.  However, area effects, environmental hazards and ongoing sources of damage such as poison are not affected.

type: Reflexive (Step 2)
key: Combo-OK
dur: Until next action
dep: samt
text: Erisians laugh in the face of danger (or sometimes behind its back), and laugh all the louder when it comes from all sides.  This Charm is used against coordinated attacks, multiple attacks and flurries.  Until his next action, penalties to the character's DV from coordinated attacks or onslaught instead become bonuses, for the purposes of dodging.

If hemmed in by multiple opponents, possibly in combination with restrictive terrain, the character replaces the usual -2 DV penalty with a +2 DV bonus.  If the opponents make coordinated or multiple attacks, further bonuses may apply, as above.  Furthermore, no attack from any of those opponents can be unexpected (though ranged attacks or area effects from elsewhere may be).

The maximum cumulative bonus from this Charm is equal to the character's (Dodge + Essence).  It does not reset until the character's next action, even though onslaught penalties normally reset at the end of each flurry.  These DV bonuses apply only against the characters making the attacks.  They do not apply to other opponents making single attacks, or to area or environmental effects.

dep: vmn
text: Some of the most powerful Mid-day Shadows go even futher in turning their enemies' hostility against them.  This Charm extends the effects of Villain Multiplication Nature to a whole scene, and allows the bonuses to accumulate from action to action.  In addition the protection applies beyond coordinated and multiple attacks: for each single attack (i.e., without a flurry or multiple attack effect) from a single opponent which the character fails to dodge, he accumulates a +1 bonus to Dodge DV for subsequent actions.  The maximum bonus remains (Dodge + Essence) and area, environmental and undodgeable attacks are not included (unless by some other Charm in a Combo).

text: Discordians often work alone, but friends are important, too.  This Charm allows the Unhinged to instantly transport a number of beings (or like-sized objects) up to (character's Essence) in Magnitude, including herself for a short distance.  The distance is determined by rolling the charcter's [Wits + Dodge] and multiplying the successes by her normal Dash distance.  A botch means that all affected by the Charm will fail to dodge the attack.  The Charm may be used in place of a normal dodging response to an attack on (or an area attack which includes) any member of the group.  The group must travel the full distance, and the distance is measured from the outside of the group, not its centre.

The character must know (or at least firmly believe) that there is a surface at the destination which is able to safely support the group.  Water will suffice, if they might all reasonably be able to swim, though acid would not.  There need not be a clear path to the endpoint, and indeed this Charm can move people through solid walls etc.  Intentional movement into midair is not possible, although it might happen accidentally if the character is mistaken in her beliefs about the terrain.  Unwilling targets may choose to remain where they are.

It is perfectly acceptable to use this Charm to appear behind an opponent.  The movement is as silent as it is instant, so an unexpected attack on the next action may be possible.  An unexpected counterattack would be possible too, if the character had some way of making a counterattack apart from Charm use.
