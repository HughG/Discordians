Opening a controlled pocket of Elsewhere, the character places into it any non-living item which she can easily hold in her hand.  While inside this pocket, the item cannot be found by normal means.  It can be retrieved as a miscellaneous action, though the character may keep the motes committed to allow her to return the item to storage, again as a miscellaneous action.  If she simply releases the committment, the item falls to the ground beside her.

A character can store away at most (Essence) items in this manner, each requiring a separate activation of this Charm.  At Essence 3, the character may stash away any object which she could lift with a feat of strength.  With Larceny 4 and Essence 4, the character may spend an point of Willpower in addition, to stash away a willing (and presumably trusting) living being.  For them, no time will seem to have passed when they are retrieved.

This Charm allows the Mid-day Shadow to exercise her pickpocketing skills through a small twist of Elsewhere, retrieving an object despite any mundane barriers which lie between her and the target.  She can retrieve an object up to (Essence) yards away, provided it is not within an area warded against teleportation.  Any other barriers or wards will not stop her theft.  Alarms triggered by the presence of something will stay dormant, though one triggered by the absence of the stolen item would activate.

Objects which are firmly held, such as weapons in use, cannot be taken with this Charm, nor can attuned artifacts.  Furthermore, the conduit it provides is not sufficient to allow feats of strength to be exercised through it.  If the character is removing an item from someone's person, treat this as a pickpockting attempt, with the base difficulty of the (Dexterity + Larceny) roll being 1.  The difficulty is not increased by inanimate bindings.  Objects in plain sight have difficulty 2, with success indicating that observers were distracted.  Victims might notice the theft immediately, but attempts to realise who carried out the theft, or where the object went, are at +5 to difficulty.

The character must have a reasonably accurate idea of the location of the item before this Charm can be used.

This Charm builds upon its prerequisite, allowing the Gatekeeper to instantly change places with a target object or being within (Essence x 5) yards.  Wards against teleportation will prevent this effect.  Unwilling beings can resist as if resisting a grapple, but at an external penalty of -(character's Essence x 2), since the attack comes from no particular direction.  Objects are only valid targets if they could be lifted by the character as a feat of strength, using (Strength + Athletics + Essence).

If the character or the target was restrained before the exchange, those restraints will switch from one to the other, though they may break or be too loose.

Activating this Charm swaps one idea from the target's surface thoughts with another from the Foolish Sage's own.  The character need not touch or lock eyes with the target, but his target must be within (Essence x 5) yards and clearly perceptible to him.  The target may resist, making an opposed roll of (Wits + Integrity) against the character's (Wits + Larceny + Essence).  If the target succeeds, he or she experiences a brief moment of distraction but is otherwise unaffected.  If not, the character takes one thought or idea from the target's surface mind and exchanges it with one of his own choosing, from his own mind.

The character cannot be certain what surface thoughts he will find, but must proceed with the exchange if the target fails the roll.  A wise Fool will therefore prime his own mind with some important and unimportant surface thoughts in advance.  A willing target may choose not to resist, in which case this Charm can be used for silent communication, of an odd sort.

The ideas exchanged cannot be fundamental to the individuals concerned, e.g., in support of Motivation or Intimacies, nor can they counter awareness of an ongoing situation, overcome survival instincts or the like.  For example, a character could not cause a Dragon-Blooded target to temporarily lose his hatred of Anathema, nor to ignore a glowing Solar Caste mark on the character's forehead, nor to ignore the character as an enemy in an ongoing battle.  However, the Charm could steal away suspicions that the character //might// be Anathema, or might be carrying concealed weapons, provided there was no ongoing evidence to support it.

The effect is not strong enough to blind either party to reality: if some new event occurs to support the idea, someone else points it out, or similar, he will regain it.  In any case, the original ideas will come back to each after the scene ends, and the replacements will remain in memory.  The target is likely to treat the replacement thought as an unexpected idea of his own, unless he has some reason to suspect mental tampering.

If used as a defense in social combat, this Charm adds 2 to the character's MDV, even if it fails, since he knows that the distraction is coming, whereas the target does not.

This Charm cannot be used against automata, although it can be used against manses or warstriders which have an animating intelligence.

This Charm supplements an action to create a disguise, enabling the character to do so in a single action, rather than the many minutes it would normally require, and use even the most tenuously applicable of props.  Use of inhumanly acute senses to penetrate the disguise is at a -2 external penalty.  Note that the character's Recumbent Destiny applies as normal.

This Charm supplements a Larceny action to construct a disguise, making it possible to disguise one item as another, of roughly equivalent size, shape and weight.  The disguise is perfect to natural senses, and the Mid-day Shadow can use this perfection to construct a flawless forgery, provided he has detailed information on the object to be copied.  However, he may just as easily take a well-known object and make it appear to be a quite mundane item of some other sort.  If supernatural or inhumanly acute senses are applied to see through the deception, the difficulty is increased by the character's Essence.  This Charm cannot disguise the magical nature of things like artifacts, so those with Essence sight might gain bonuses to attempts to see the true nature of a magical item.  Then again, a cunning Discordian might just choose to disguise a famous daiklave as an ordinary daiklave of the same magical material.

This Charm supplements a Disguise action in which the character attempts to make herself up as some non-human being of roughly equivalent size, be it of animal, spirit, demon or some other sort.  It removes any increases in difficulty to the roll due to noticeable differences in size or gender, as well as body type, although attempting to look like a specific individual still adds +1 to the difficulty.  The natural senses of animals, demons etc. gain them no bonuses in seeing through the deception, but supernatural senses will help as normal.  The disguise does not affect the character's Essence signature, but all Discordians may use their innate abilities to disguise that.

This powerful Charm allows One Who Stands in the Doorway to take the identity of another: not simply to copy their appearance, but poosibly also to remove their unique self from them.  Doing so requires a resisted roll of the character's (Willpower + Larceny + Essence) against the target's (Wits + Integrity + Essence), including any applicable defences against Shaping.  A willing target may accept the effect without resisting.

Provided the character gains at least one success on his roll, he becomes seemingly identical to the target, to all natural senses.  This includes apparently duplicating all mundane and magical equipment.  Magical equipment will be non-functional, though it will bear the appropriate Essence signature; or, if the character possesses a reasonably similar artifact, he may cloak it in the identity of part of the target's panoply.  Beings with inhumanly acute senses may make a Perception + Awareness roll to spot an imperfection in this mimicry, with no bonuses.  Those with magical senses such as Essence sight may also do so, with a +2 bonus.  The character's Recumbent Destiny functions as normal, so this imposturing may be forgotten once the character leaves.  If the character and target are both within Fate, their strands appears to be entwined; if one or other is outside Fate, the other strand appears frayed.

If character gains at least one threshold success over the target, or the target does not resist, that being is immediately subject to an effect similar to those of a Recumbent Destiny.  All beings apart from the character himself who observe the target must make a (Wits + Occult) roll at a difficulty equal to the number of threshold successes.  If they fail, they will not later accurately recall the presence, identity or actions of the target over the duration, or even perceive them accurately while the target is still present.  Even if the target's presence is noted, her identity will appear to be that of some miscellaneous extra, rather than her own.  Protestations from the victim do not give any bonus on this roll.

[TODO: Should the victim be able to make the same roll as Erisians, to suppress this for a scene?]

[TODO: Should the duration be limited to 23 days or something?]

The value or desirability of an object can be increased (or decreased) by application of this Charm.  It casts an Illusion or Emotion effect over some item, which subtly changes how it is perceived in one of two ways.

In the simpler case, the character may choose to increase (or decrease, to a minimum of 0) the item's apparent Resources value by up to her (Larceny ÷ 2).  Anyone may spend 1 Willpower to see through this Illusion; if they then point it out to others, they will immediately see through it as well.

Alternatively, she may use an Emotion effect to make it more viscerally appealing.  At the time the Charm is acivated, the character rolls his (Manipulation + Larceny + Essence) and records the number of successes.  All who observe the item while the Charm remains active (apart from the character himself) must compare their Dodge MDV against those successes: if it is less, they gain a desire to obtain the item, though not necessarily immediately.  The strength of the desire depends on the number of successes above the threshold.  Again, observers may spend a point of Willpower to shake off this desire, but doing so does not give them a way to free others from the effect, since it is only their own desire which is affected.  On the other hand, the character may keep specific others from this effect by telling them about it, before or after using the Charm.
