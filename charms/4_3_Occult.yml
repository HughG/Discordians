  This Charm is similar to the Elemental Charm known as Elemental Expression.
  Activating it costs 3 motes and one point of Willpower; the character can then
  spend up to (Essence) further motes to modify manifestations of her Divisional
  or Parametadivisional element.  Each mote spent can either halve
  or double the effect of any phenomena related to the element.  Alternatively,
  on successfully touching a target, the Erisian can either add one
  level of lethal or bashing damage (for physical manifestations) or reduce the
  target's temporary Willpower by 1 point (for mental or emotional
  manifestations).  In this case, the attack will be accompanied by a
  manifestation of the Erisian element, in one or more senses.  If the attack is
  blocked or parried, this Charm is inapplicable.

  The Unhinged find it fairly simple to tune in to mystical vibrations.
  This Charm allows the character to sense dematerialised beings, within a range
  of (Essence x 20) yards, in all ways except touch.  It also reveals the
  precise location of mystical portals between realities such as Yu-Shan, the
  Labyrinth and so on -- although not how to operate them.

  From the right angle, portals to the spirit world can be seen as
  revolving doors.  Given a willing target, activating this Charm allows the
  character to become dematerialized and the target material, or vice versa as
  appropriate.  The change persists until this Charm or some other effect
  changes things again.  This Charm may also be used on an unwilling target, but
  it may resist by spending a point of temporary Willpower.  The character may
  use this Charm in combination with an attack, in which case they can strike
  the target for that action only, even if they could not normally strike
  (de)materialized targets, and regardless of whether the target resists the
  exchange.
  
  Beings left in a state which is not their natural one may return to normal by
  spending a point of Willpower, once 23 days have elapsed.

  Attuned as they are to the underlying fabric of multiple realities, the
  followers of Eris have a keen facility in perceiving significant supernatural
  power.  With this Charm active, the character can detect all instant or
  ongoing effects of Charms, Sorcery, Shaping (including Sidereal astrology) and
  similar supernatural effects (e.g., geomancy) in a range equal to (Essence x
  5) yards.  The exact power level and nature of a single effect can be
  determined on a reflexive ([Perception or Wits] + Occult) roll, difficulty
  equal to the Essence of the source (or 3, if not applicable).  This Charm does
  not directly allow the character to perceive supernatural beings as such,
  except insofar as they use the above powers.

  At times the glories of the Exalted should remain hidden.  This Charm
  allows the character to choose one of those times, completely suppressing the
  anima banner of an Exalted being and instantly deactivating any anima powers.
  The target may, of course, re-activate anima powers or cause their anima
  banner to flare again on subsequent actions.  The character may target himself
  with this Charm, in which case the cost is halved.  Use of this Charm purely
  for amusement purposes on Water-Aspected Dragon-Blooded is somewhat frowned
  upon.

  Why should the Discordians get all the fun?  This closely-guarded ritual
  allows a Wild Child to grant another willing being the ability to use one of
  her own Charms.  As long as the target has this Charm, she will be unable to
  use it, though she may recall it before the end of the scene as a reflexive
  action.  The target is treated as having the necessary Essence and Ability
  minimums, if it doesn't already, solely for the purpose of using that Charm
  and making any rolls it involves.  If the target does not already have a mote
  pool, it is treated as having 10 motes, which can only be used for the purpose
  of activating that Charm, and vanish at the end of the scene in which the
  target first uses the Charm.  If the Charm costs more than 10 motes to
  activate, the character must commit additional motes, up to the cost of a
  single activation.

  Although the Gatekeepers are unable to learn the Charms of other Exalted
  types (as, for instance, the Eclipse Caste Solars can do), this obscure
  technique allows them to temporarily copy another's Charm.
  
  On activating this Charm, if the target is unwilling, they may make a
  contested roll of their (Wits + Integrity) against the character's
  ([Manipulation or Wits] + Occult) to prevent the character copying the Charm.
  Of course, a successful dodge, or defense against Shaping, will also cause
  this Charm to fail.
  
  If successful, the character gains the ability to use the copied Charm once,
  provided she satisfies its minimums and pays its activation cost.  The
  character can only copy a Charm which she has observed the target use in the
  current scene.

text: |
  TODO
  
  This Charm allows the character to remove a single Shaping effect from its
  target, either at the instant it is applied, or any time afterward in the case
  of ongoing Shaping effects.  The character explicitly can apply this Charm to
  a Shaping effect which target him.  The character retains the potential of the
  effect as long as he maintains the Charm's mote commitment, and may re-apply
  it reflexively to any target which he successfully touches, which may require
  a Martial Arts roll in the case of an unwilling target.  If the character
  fails to hit the new target, he retains the effect for later use, but if he
  makes contact, the Charm ends and he no longer has use of the effect, even if
  the new target successfully resists it.
  
  Alternatively, he may simply release the motes, in which case a ghostly
  rainbow outline forms, resembling the original target as it appeared with the
  Shaping effect applied.  Anyone who comes into contact with this outline
  becomes the new target of the Shaping effect, though it will dissipate at the
  end of the scene in which it formed.
  
  In the case of a Sidereal destiny being removed from its original target,
  pattern spiders may notice the change, and may (or may not) choose to inform
  its creator.
  
  If the character moves a Numerology effect, its balance will be maintained.
  If the balance was to apply to its original target, then both the original
  target and the new target will suffer the balance, once after the other, in
  proportion to the time for which they enjoyed its benefits.  If the balance
  was to apply to the Discordian who applied the Numerology, then the balance
  instead spends part of its time afflicting its originator, followed by part
  applying to the character who used this Charm.

  This Charm gives the Children of Eris access to Terrestrial Circle
  Sorcery, only they changed the name, just because.  Oh, alright, if you must
  know, it's because the number of sides of these two figures add up to the
  mystical five (given that a circle has an in-side and an out-side).  The
  character may instead purchase a version of this Charm which provides access
  to Shadowlands Circle Necromancy, known as Triangular Circle Necromancy.  Both
  versions may be purchased separately by the same character.

  The Beloved of the Most Beatiful get away with breaking all sorts of
  rules, and they have gained limited access to the Solar's most powerful
  spells.  Specifically, they steal them.
  
  This Charm can be activated in response to a Cast Sorcery or Cast Necromancy
  action taken by another.  The Erisian's player and that of the target make a
  contested (Essence + Occult + Willpower) roll.  If the target succeeds, the
  sorcery proceeds normally and the target will not notice.  Otherwise, the
  spell is interrupted but, rather than the energies dissipating or exploding,
  they are transferred to the character, for as long as he maintains the mote
  commitment for this Charm.  In this case, the target must still pay the mote
  and willpower cost for the spell.
  
  The character may thereafter release the mote commitment and either allow the
  spell to dissipate harmlessly, or cast it himself.  He can take a Cast Sorcery
  action on the action immediately following the use of this Charm, effectively
  redirecting the spell in a manner, and towards targets, of his choice.  In
  this case, he pays one less than the normal Willpower cost for the spell, and
  only half the mote cost.  If he waits till later, however, he must take 1-3
  Shape Sorcery actions, and pay the full mote and Willpower cost as normal,
  before he can take the Cast Sorcery action.  Shaping or casting the spell is
  Obvious, as usual, but use of this Charm is not.
  
  This Charm cannot be used once a spell has been cast, nor can it be used to
  counter an ongoing spell, or undo the lasting effects of sorcery.  The
  character can retain any number of as-yet-uncast spells which are of a type he
  could normally cast, if he can afford the mote commitment for them.  Only one
  Solar Circle or Void Circle spell may be retained at any one time, however.
  Once an instance of a stolen spell is cast, the character is unable to cast it
  again, until he captures another casting of it.
