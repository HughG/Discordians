  The character adopts a position and stance which enable him to fit into his
  current environment, and activates this Charm, helping him appear to be part
  of the scenery.  Firstly, it removes all penalties to contested Stealth rolls
  due to an inappropriate environment (for example, lack of cover).  Secondly,
  it adds (Stealth รท 2) automatic successes to all such rolls.  Lastly, it
  allows him to use Manipulation in place of Dexterity when making the Stealth
  roll, if desired.  Other beings will not normally walk into the character
  accidentally, since they see him but do not recognise him for what he is,
  subliminally assuming him to be a lamp, bush, dead body or other appropriate
  item.  Effects which reveal information contradicting this may give a bonus to
  those attempting to notice the character, such as those which detect life or
  essence.
  
  This Charm ends immediately if the character moves, makes some sensory
  impression greater than the background level, activates an Obvious Charm, or
  takes a Join Battle action.  If joining battle he may apply the benefits of
  this Charm to an unexpected attack as his first action.  The concealment
  enhancements offered by this Charm have no effect on those who were able to
  perceive the character in the tick before he activated it, so the character
  cannot use it to reestablish surprise during battle without first finding some
  other way to hide.

  This Charm allows the character to draw a twisting, fractal-folded shroud of
  the unfabric of Elsewhere around her form, almost entirely removing her from
  the reality in which she stands.  While hidden she cannot move with respect to
  her original location, and will always reappear there when the Charm ends.
  
  All mundane attempts to observe or interact with her automatically fail,
  meaning that mortals may walk right through the space she previously occupied.
  Charms or other magic which attempt to locate her, or hidden things, or the
  magic of the Charm itself, have their base difficulty increased to her
  (Stealth + Essence) if it would otherwise be less.  If detection succeeds, the
  character's location is determined with an accuracy of ([threshold successes -
  character's Stealth] x 5) yards, to a minimum of pinpoint accuracy at zero
  yards.  Against automatically successful effects such as Eye of the
  Unconquered Sun, this Charm forces a contested roll and adds the character's
  Stealth in automatic successes.
  
  While concealed, the character cannot be spatially targeted for any actions
  other than attempts to locate her.  Even once her location is precisely known,
  she cannot be targeted with physical weapons, even magical ones, or Touch
  effects.  Damage and other unpleasant effects from natural area effects are
  completely negated, while those from magical sources are delayed (Essence)
  actions as the magic must work its way through strange folds of space to reach
  the character.  If the character notices such an effect and deactivates the
  Charm before it reaches her, she is unaffected, though the effect might still
  be active in her original location.
  
  The downside of this Charm is that the character's isolation works both ways,
  so she suffers a -4 external penalty to perceive events in her original
  location, including magical area effects which might hurt her after a delay.
  She cannot target anything or anyone there with any individually targeted or
  area actions or effects, mundane or magical, other than to observe them.
  
  Effects which allow someone to see into Elsewhere completely bypass this
  Charm's concealment, but do not normally work around the protection from
  damage it provides.  It is not possible for the character to use any magical
  effects which guarantee absolute success to see out from under her cloak,
  though she may enhance her senses, including use of the second excellency.
  Effects which target a being as a unique individual or through some arcane or
  other remote link also completely bypass this Charm's shield, in either
  direction, and are not delayed by it.  The character is not made immaterial by
  this Charm and so is not specially affected by magic which targets such
  beings.

  *[TODO: Work out how to ref Ink Monkeys Charms in two places: by volume and
  in the collected works.]*
  
  *[TODO: Dammit, this is basically a duplicate of the Larceny Charm "Flawless
  Transfiguration Knack".  Need to merge the two.  Maybe turn this into a
  Charm to hide an item altogether, possibly by placing it among similar
  items, or even similar shapes -- e.g., hiding a sword among hanging folds of
  a cloak?]*
  
  The character applies this Charm to a mundane object to make make it seem
  unremarkable.  Resisting this Illusion costs two points of temporary
  Willpower.  Any or all distinguishing features can be removed, including
  shaping, coloration, markings, and so on, but the basic nature of the object
  cannot be changed.  Whether something is remarkable depends on context, so
  straightening a curved sword might be appropriate in some parts of creation,
  or the reverse in other places, but it could never be disguised as a staff.
  The Storyteller is the final arbiter of what is possible.  The disguise can
  reduce the apparent Resources value of an object by up to (Stealth รท 2), to a
  minimum of one dot, and can disguise perfect, exceptional or fine items as
  ones of a lesser degree of superiority, or of a standard level of quality.
  Observers can still provide an accurate description of the object, but that
  description is likely to match many other instances of its kind.
  
  At Essence 3, this Charm can also be applied to artifacts, either to make a
  unique item appear generic, or even concealing magical items as mundane.  The
  character can create an Illusion which removes unique features from an
  artifact's appearance, or reduces the apparent Artifact rating of an item by
  up to (Stealth) dots, to a minimum of zero, or both.
  
  At higher Stealth/Ess, apply to objects not in the character's possession, and
  to living beings?  BUT compare to Larceny Charms Instant Image Improvisation
  and Identity Theft.
  
  *[NOTE: sort of the opposite of Larceny Charm Value-Adding Veneer.]*

  This Charm improves its prerequisite, allowing it to be applied to a group of
  beings up to the character's (Essence - 1) in Magnitude, or to one or more
  inanimate objects in a volume of space roughly equivalent in size to that
  number of humans, or any equivalent combination of beings and objects.
  Observers who fail to see through the concealment will intepret the group as
  some larger innocuous background object, such as a hedge or pile of rubble.
  
  Additionally, the group may take Move, but not Dash, actions at up to a third
  of its normal movement rate.  Doing so does not automatically break
  concealment but prompts another (Perception + Awareness) roll from observers
  and gives them a +2 dice circumstance bonus: observers may not see the group
  as a moving large object, but may become suspicious and notice that it doesn't
  quite seem to be in the same place at different points in time.  The character
  may use this Charm on himself alone to allow movement while concealed.  If the
  Charm is deactived once those concealed have found some other suitable cover,
  it provides no benefits on further Awareness checks, but ending the Charm does
  not in itself prompt such a check.
  
  Used in War, the Charm has a Speed of 5 long ticks and may conceal any unit
  that the character is a member of, not only one he leads, though he must be
  able to persuade the unit to act in such a way as not to counteract the
  concealment.  The Charm is not limited to a given Magnitude of unit but,
  similar to normal attempts at concealment in battle, the character rolls
  ([Dexterity or Manipulation] + Stealth - Magnitude).  The unit need not have
  cover but, if it does, the Storyteller may assign additional bonuses, for
  example treating any DV bonuses against ranged attaks (Exalted Core, p. 147)
  as providing equivalent bonus dice to the roll.

  This Charm wraps the Exalt's normal self inside another, constructed
  personality and body, enabling her to act as a deep-cover agent over a
  prolonged period.
  
  Her identity is buried so deeply that even she will not be aware of who she
  truly is.  On activation she must specify at least one trigger condition which
  will cause the Charm to end, and may specify up to (Essence) independent
  triggers.  The condition must be one which her new identity would be able to
  perceive and understand, in terms of normal and magical senses, languages
  known and so on.  It can be as simple or as complex as desired, but will only
  be triggered when the new identity becomes aware of it.  So, for example, a
  trigger to end the Charm "when the Jade Prison is broken" would only take
  effect when the new self learned that it had happened, not when it actually
  occurred.  Indeed, it would trigger when he believed that it had happened,
  even if the prison was in fact still sealed.  Similarly, "when I meet Chejop
  Kejak's murderer" would trigger when the new self believed that he had met
  someone who had committed that murder, even if they had not, nor if he met the
  murderer but didn't realise it.
  
  The character may choose any of the following types of being for her new self:
  another Discordian of the same Division and Parametadivision, having up to her
  current Essence; a being of the type which her Parametadivision mimics, again
  having up to her current Essence; a mortal or unenlightened heroic mortal up
  to Essence 2 (or equivalent unenlightened being in any realm of reality); or
  even a god, spirit, demon or similar being not belonging to a
  Parametadivision, up to her current Essence, although this choice is risky
  because she is granted no particular magic to mimic the powers of such beings.
  
  If the character chooses an unenlightened identity, she cannot spend motes
  except to subconsiously activate non-Obvious Reflexive Charms using her
  Personal pool.  She will interpret these powers as moments of good fortune.
  Other expenditures will end the Charm.  Applying or resisting unnatural mental
  influence still gains the character points of Hodge and Podge while in her
  disguised form, though she will be unaware of their effects and may not
  understand when she enters Limit Break.  Any magical effects which have made
  certain things unacceptable orders, beyond those which would harm her, still
  apply to her new self.
  
  The new self may have any physical appearance appropriate to the chosen type
  of being, with the same Appearance rating.  The Charm cannot perfectly
  duplicate another being's form, though it can create someone reasonably
  similar in appearance.
  
  Donning this new guise, the character is subject to a reversed Recumbent
  Destiny effect, as powerful as if she had spent her full temporary Willpower
  pool on it.  Memories and minor details of reality are shaped to make it seem
  that this new identity has existed since the onset time of the Recumbent
  Destiny, and those affected will remember the new face clearly.  Attempts to
  find the character with the Loom of Fate are not impeded.  Instead the
  increased difficulty applies if anyone tries to follow the thread back to the
  original identity.
  
  The Discordian's new self has the same Traits as her original self, except for
  Motivation, Intimacies and Backgrounds.  The new identity has an entirely new
  Motivation, selected by the character when the Charm is activated.  Likewise
  new Intimacies are selected, under the control of the Storyteller, though the
  player may make suggestions.  The character loses access to all her existing
  Backgrounds except for Artifact and Manse (and its Underworld and Heavenly
  variants), and will lose even Manse if she chooses an unenlightened identity.
  However, she gains up to 15 dots of Backgrounds appropriate to her new
  identity.  Those involving power and other people will not extend beyond the
  Magnitued of people affected by the reversed Recumbent Destiny effect which
  accompanies this Charm.
  
  At Essence 5+, this hiding of self persists even after death.  The character's
  death will not end the Charm's effects and, if the Storyteller decides that
  Discordian Exaltations pass on to new hosts, then the new host will not
  experience the effects of Exaltation, or be aware of his power, until the
  trigger conditions are satisfied.  This may be part of the reason why no
  Erisian Exalts have been seen for a long time.
  
  Lastly, this Charm is Stackable: the character can activate as many
  simultaneous hidden identities at once as her temporary Willpower pool affords
  her.  The stacking of these identities must be decided in advance, so that
  triggering the end of one will shift her to another preselected one, losing
  the first completely.  The reversed Recumbent Destiny effect is triggered at
  the same time, so that her new identity is more likely to be accepted.
