[Like Archery bbta.  Can be used in a Combo Step 1 to automatically recall the
weapon after the attack succeeds or fails -- even if the attack itself
botches.]

separate Charm as in Archery.]

[Creates an Illusion of part of the Erisian's presence (shadow, voice,
creaking floorboards etc.) being some short-ish distance away from where it
really is, with some variation in details [controllable with a stunt, or
always just "subtly different"?].  Must mime an attack toward the target point
at the start of the Charm, and can't move it thereafter, though she may move
herself.  Effect a bit like Solar's Observer-Deceiving Attack makes observers
roll to guess right between the target location and the Exalt's real location,
if she attacks, or takes other actions dependent on her location, such as
attempting to lure/persuade people towards/away from her fake location.  Note,
however, that that Charm is Instant, so this one can't be as good.]

Thrown in place of Martial Arts for initial attack.  Can attack with some
small range -- Jump distance?  Some kind of bonus?  Bonus if immediately
[and/or?] eventually choosing to Break Hold by throwing the opponent away?
Maybe, if attack fails, character isn't automatically grappled himself ... but
is Knockback'ed???]

key: Combo-OK, Compulsion
dur: One scene

text: TODO

The Erisian makes a throwing or stabbing motion his weapon, without actually
releasing it, and rolls an attack as normal.  The attack causes no damage, is
unblockable with mundane weapons or armor, applies a -2 external penalty to
the target's DV due to its invisibilty, and is unaffected by Hardness or soak.
Steps 7 and 8 of attack resolution will be irrelevant, unless some unusual
Reflexive Charm applies.

If the attack achieves even one success, this Charm inflicts a Compulsion on
the target, to stay pinned to the spot.  Resisting the influence costs two
Willpower, and will make the target aware of the attempt at unnatural
influence.

An affected target may turn on the spot, and can act and defect herself as
usual, provided she does not move to another location.  The target will not
willingly take so much as a Move action, nor consent to effects which would
move her.  If moved forcibly, or due to terrain or environmental effects, the
target will then attempt to stay at her new location.  If remaining in place
presents a real risk of death, the Compulsion becomes an unacceptable order
and the effect ends.  The target may end the effect at any point during the
scene by paying the two Willpower, not only at the point when the Compulsion
would take hold.

Using this attack does not end any Stealth effects on the character, unless
the target successfully resists the influence using Willpower at the moment of
the initial attack.

[Creates a new Intimacy, toward a thrown object or toward the person or object
which it hits.  Affects all who witness the attack, except for the Erisian and
the target itself.  Can spend [X] Willpower to resist.  Intimacy appears at
full strength and lasts [one day?  one scene?] [and magically resists
removal?] by default.  Thereafter it fades at one point per [day?], unless an
affected being spends at least one scene acting in a way which reinforces the
intimacy, in which case it stabilises.  This Charm does not magically
reinforce the intimacy after the first [scene/day], so it may be removed as
normal.]
