  Provides clear understanding of all departments and factions within the
  organisation, official and unofficial, identifying the true leaders of each.
  This gives the character (Essence รท 2) bonus successes to subsequent
  Bureaucracy actions in the scene which relate to influencing one specific
  faction, or altering tensions between groups.  Information on the leaders'
  identities is retained permanently, though leadership may change later.

  With knowledge of the overt and covert roles and communication channels
  in an organisation, the Exalt is able to arrange for her own pet project to be
  achieved without drawing attention to it.  The maximum duration of the project
  in days is equal to the largest group size for a Magnitude one less than the
  organisation's size; for example, a bureaucracy of 200 is Magnitude 4, so the
  maximum duration would be 150 days (the largest size of a Magnitude 3 group),
  or a little over 5 months.  The maximum Resources which can be diverted
  without attracting attention is half the group's Magnitude, rounded up, but no
  more than the Resources available to the group itself.  Again for example,
  from this 200-strong office, Resources 2 could be diverted, assuming they
  commanded at least Resources 2 in the first place.

  Whereas some would improve the efficiency of an organisation by directly
  reshaping it, the Discordian knows that the same ends can often be achieved
  simply by gently adjusting the goals of the individuals within it.  The Exalt
  subtly influences the organisation so that, despite still following selfish
  internal goals, its various parts effectively work much more successfully
  towards an overall aim.  The Charm supplements a dramatic action, adding the
  character's subtle guidance and suggestion to a project.  He mst be involved
  in its execution, but need not lead the action, nor even be a member of the
  group.  It reduces internal penaltes on the action by the group's Magnitude.
  If the character's involvement is not obvious to most of the group, and the
  action succeeds, then the group puts this success down in good part to the
  particular way they worked, thereby permanently reducing internal penalties by
  one point, as a mysterious air of good feeling persists after the project.
  The total permanent reduction in penalties for a given group over repeated
  application of this Charm cannot exceed the Exalt's Essence, although the
  temporary improvement may.

  Eclipse-caste Solars bind others, not always willing, in oaths of
  servitude enforced by the might of Heaven.  The Unbending Arm, however,
  recognises that oaths are more likely to remain unbroken if they are fairly
  made, and can seal a pargain with the unbalanced balance of the power of Eris.
  This Charm allows a Discordian to magically reinforce an oath between two
  individuals or groups, provided each side swears freely.  The character may be
  one of those affected, but need not be.  Unwilling parties are not valid
  targets for this Charm, nor are those whose willingness comes only through
  threats, mental influence, social attacks or breaking of Motivation.  This is
  true regardless of the source of the influence, or whether or not it was
  specifically intended to persuade the target into accepting an oath.
  
  Assuming both parties willingly swear to their side of the bargain, the magic
  of the Charm ensures that the first party to break the oath will suffer a
  single occurrence of terrible misfortune, similar to the Eclipse-caste anima
  ability.  At the same time, all beings bound by the oath (and the character,
  if he is not one of the parties) will know that the it was broken, and by
  whom.  If the wronged party subsequently takes steps to gain redress, they
  will benefit from a perfect success on one action in pursuit of that goal, at
  a highly opportune moment.
  
  Without the power of Yu-Shan behind it, given that Eris generally likes folk
  to fend for themselves, this binding lasts only until the Exalt dies.  Both
  parties will know if this happens, and can distinguish it from a breaking of
  the oath.  Eliciting an oath of truce from some enemy may therefore not be
  particularly useful, but a fair trade may fend off violence, at least until
  both sides have done their part.  There are no ancient pacts to protect any
  Division of Discordians as they wander the worlds, but most intelligent beings
  can be bargained with, if the price is right.

  The Bishops of Greyface enjoy spreading confusion, particularly around
  the fundamental issue, for an organisation, of exactly what it is supposed to
  be doing.  Employing this charm, the player rolls ([Charisma or Manipulation]
  + Bureaucracy + Essence) with a difficulty equal to the leader's MDV.  If
  successful, the organisation forgets its Motivation; it will not act against
  it (unless otherwise compelled) but neither will it act in support of it, with
  the leader likely to spend Loyalty points to resist external attempts to
  persuade the organisation to do so.  The leader may also spend Loyalty to
  resist or shake off this Illusion, however.  Spending one point lifts it for a
  single scene, and spending a cumulative total of three ends the effect.
  
  An organisation affected by this Illusion is not completely paralysed.  It
  will still carry on minor day-to-day activities, giving the surface appearance
  of being functional.  It may also successfully carry out activities not
  related to its main Motivation.  Applying this Charm to small outposts of the
  Immaculate Order can be particularly amusing.

  The sometimes crazed notions of the Unbending Arm are nonetheless
  unusually compelling.  Using this Charm, the character communicates a new
  Policy to an organisation, the means depending on its magnitude and how widely
  spread it is.  It may be sufficient to talk directly to senior figures, or it
  may be necessary to send memos to each department.
  
  The player rolls ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Bureaucracy + Essence) when
  stating the new mission.  Either side may gain a bonus to MDV due to relative
  Magnitude, as normal.  If the character's successes exceed the leader's MDV,
  the target group takes on the mission as a new Intimacy, to be pursued to the
  best of its ability.  The leader of the unit may spend two points of Loyalty
  to resist this effect.  If the roll succeeds but the mission is in conflict
  with the group's Motivation, it loses a dot of Magnitude, and those lost
  immediately form a splinter group with the mission as their Motivation.  If
  the new goal is in line with the organisation's Motivation, then they will
  drop all other activities to pursue it for the first (Essence) days, throwing
  financial and political caution to the winds (although not ignoring the need
  to eat and sleep -- work/life balance is important, y'know).
  
  If persuaded departments are sufficiently distant from each other, the new
  mission will not actually affect them until they get word of it.  Spreading
  the mission to these departments will be one of the first priorities of the
  organisation.  However, if a message fails to reach within (Essence) weeks of
  it being sent, it will have lost its magic and be ignored on receipt.  This
  can result in even greater confusion as different departments act on the
  mission at different times.  There is still only a single roll to determine
  whether the mission is adopted, however.

  Confusion can be a gift, in the right hands; though, as ever, it is
  better to give than to receive.  This Charm can be used in social,
  bureaucratic or mass combat situations, against some organised unit.  It
  disrupts lines of communication and supply to make it harder for a target unit
  to achieve its goals.  The effects employed are extremely subtle, applying an
  external penalty of (character's permanent Essence) to any attempts to
  discover the source of the problem.
  
  For social units, vital phrases are misunderstood, the right people can't be
  found, and important tasks are forgotten briefly.  Together, these amount to a
  -4 external penalty applied to any attempts to get the group to work in an
  organised way in support of its Motivation or any of its Policies, for the
  next 24 hours.  After that, the penalty reduces by 1 each day until it returns
  to normal, or until the Leader spends a point of Loyalty to reassert control,
  in which case penalties vanish immediately.
  
  Applied to a bureaucratic organisation it is even more effective, in a
  narrower way.  In relation to a chosen project, memos are lost, official seals
  break, key staff members fall ill and so on.  All this imposes a -4 external
  penalty to all its actions for the day and, once the scene has ended, the
  consequent confusion delays the project by (character's [Bureacuracy x
  Essence]) days.  A cumulative expenditure of (character's Bureacuracy) points
  of Loyalty by the leader can bring the project back on track sooner.
  
  In a battle it is less effective, but still useful in the right situation.  It
  will cause a target unit to act as if it had 2 fewer Relays than it actually
  does (often provoking communications failure, leading to a -2 Drill penalty),
  and will remove 2 points of bonuses to Might, as supplies are lost, ammunition
  is delivered to the wrong units, and maintenance orders for Magitech are
  misdirected, causing them to work poorly, if at all.  These penalties vanish
  the next day.

  So dedicated are the Priests of Eris to meddling with established order
  that they have elevated its practice to a level of refinement normally
  reserved for martial artists.  The Greyface Exalt brings forth an
  official-looking but nonsesical form, or improvises one from materials at
  hand, and meditates briefly on the futilty of filling it out, after which it
  disappears in a puff of smoke.  While this Charm is active, he adds half of
  the highest of his Backing, Contacts, Cult, Followers and Influence
  Backgrounds to his Dodge DV and Dodge MDV, as he bends strands of Fate (or
  other dominant reality substrate) to redirect possible injury into these
  larger structures.  The mote cost of all Bureaucracy Charms is reduced by (his
  permanent Essence), to a minimum of 1m, and the durations of any Dramatic
  Actions based on Bureaucracy (using Charms or not), started during that scene,
  are divided by (his permanent Essence).  Lastly, for the duration of the
  scene, the character may use any individual Martial Arts Charm, or Martial
  Arts Combo, as part of an impromptu Combo with any single Bureaucracy Charm,
  or Bureaucracy Combo, at the cost of an additional point of Willpower each
  time.  This is likely to be most useful with Excellencies, or with some
  peculiar Sidereal Martial Arts.

  Too often, those who serve a larger cause get caught up in that service
  and give it more credence than they give themselves; which is something to be
  taken advantage of.  This Charm causes an organistion to lose all record of a
  particular fact, or introduces a new "fact" into their archives and common
  understanding.  It must be activated in the presence of a member of the
  organisation, or in one of its offices, permanent or temporary.  The
  organisation must have a Magnitude of no more than the character's (Essence +
  Bureaucracy).  The datum added or removed must be about something external to
  the organisation; so, for example, an Erisian cannot make himself the new
  leader of the Immaculate Order.
  
  Any member of the organisation who was in the process of dealing with that
  fact (if it disappeared) or a closely related subject (if it just appeared)
  may resist the effect as unnatural mental influence, at a cost of 1 Willpower
  per scene, with the effect lifting (for them) once they have spend a
  cumulative total of 3 Willpower.  If they resist, they will be certain of the
  original truth of the matter, even though many of their colleagues may be
  baffled by their strange opinion.  For those who cannot or fail to resist,
  they immediately come to believe the new truth.
  
  Note that there is nothing preventing the organisation from subsequently
  correcting its observations and updating its records.  However, in the short
  term, this Charm can be remarkably useful for such tasks as escaping from the
  attentions of the Wyld Hunt.  Also, for information which is truly hard to
  discover, the organisation may never be able to re-learn the truth.

  A word in the right butterfly-like ear can have unexpected effects far
  away.  This Charm supplements an attempt by the character to manipulate a
  single in-process decision within an organisation.  Its target is any single
  member of the organisation, no matter how lowly: the magic of the Charm will
  work its way toward the real decision-maker (who may or may not be the one
  officially in that role).
  
  The character makes a contested ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Bureaucracy)
  roll against the target's (Intelligence + [Integrity or Bureaucracy]).  If it
  is directly in opposition to the group's Motivation, and the group's Magnitude
  exceeds the Exalt's Essence, the attempt automatically fails.  Mere Policies
  (Intimacies) do not afford this protection, however.  If successful, the
  decision will go the way the character desires.  As with the Record-Correction
  Maneuver, there is nothing to prevent the organisation from changing the
  decision later, depending on its Motivation and tendencies -- unless, of
  course, it's too late.  The decision will not be changed back for at least
  (character's Essence) days, however.
  
  This Charm is only effective upon decisions which the organisation was already
  intending to make, and has not yet settled.  It cannot force a group to decide
  to do something which had never crossed its collective mind.

  Trying to maintain control of a large organisation is a wearing task,
  which is why the Children of Eris prefer to just jump to the top of the heap
  temporarily.  With this Charm, the hand of Authority takes control of an
  organisation for one scene.  The original Leader is supplanted and all members
  of the group will recognise the character as the woman in charge.  They are
  not blindly compelled to obey orders, but will generally accept even drastic
  changes in the Motivation of the group, for example, unless they have strong
  and very personal reasons not to.  Once the effect ends, all will be fully
  aware of what they have just done, although they probably won't understand
  why.
  
  If the character attempts to use this Charm on a group more than once, any
  individuals who interacted with her on previous occasions may resist the
  effect as unnatural mental influence, at a cost of 2wp.

  TODO
  
  This Charm allows a character to indirectly influence the behaviour of a group
  by manipulating its circumstances.  It supplements a Bureacracy action which
  affects some aspect of the group or a society within which it operates,
  allowing the character to use unnatural mental influence to impose a
  Compulsion, adding some new Intimacy to the group's Policy.  The action must
  either affect the group directly, or affect a number of people equal to
  (target group's Magnitude + 1) in the relevant larger society, and must
  succeed for the Charm to take effect.  However, it need not apparently relate
  to the new Intimacy in any way.  For example, simply buying goods or services
  from the group would be sufficient.
  
  The change takes effect over the course of the month after the character makes
  her trades, bribes officials to change laws or whatever her action was.  At
  Essence 4 this is reduced to a week, and at Essence 5 to one day.  Only after
  this point does the desired new Policy affect the group.  Thereafter the
  policy persists unless and until the group's leader spends a cumulative total
  of 8 points of Loyalty to shake off the effect.  Any groups of Magnitude 1 or
  more which split off from the main group, any time after the Charm is
  activated, must separately spend Loyalty points to counter the effect.
  
  Mundane attempts to discern the source of the effect automatically fail, and
  those supplemented by magic are subject to an external penalty equal to the
  character's Essence.
