text: The chosen of Eris are not immune to Chaos, but they have a deeper
understanding of it than others.  This Charm allows the character to alter the
consequences of a Shaping effect when it is successfully applied to him.  For
Wyld mutations, they may alter the severity level by one in either direction
(including choosing to completely ignore the least severe mutations).  For
other Shaping effects which numerically alter some trait, they may adjust the
value by one, again in either direction.  For Shaping effects which do not
fall into these categories, the player may agree some appropriate adjustment
with the storyteller.

text: The Bishops of Greyface do not gladly suffer Chaos when it gets in their
way.  With this Charm the character may undo any one Shaping effect which has
altered her at any point in time.  If the Shaping affected more individuals
than just the character, she will be the only one to escape it.  A ghostly
orange outline of the character will persist, hanging in space for one scene,
embodying that sloughed-off magic.  If any other being touches it before the
scene expires, the original effect is immediately applied to them, though they
may use any powers of their own to resist it.

key: Combo-OK, Social

dep: exc

text: Wise men have often said that genius and madness are linked, but only
the Chosen of Eris have found a way to turn their madness into genius.  This
Charm allows the Exalt to add the lower of her Hodge and Podge ratings to her
Dodge MDV and Parry MDV against one attack.


name: ddt, Dream Deflection*Technique
cost: 5m
mins: Integrity 3, Ess 2
type: Reflexive (Step 9)
key: Combo-OK, Counterattack, Illusion, Social
dur: Instant
dep: umd

text: To attempt to twist the minds of those who make up the Unbending Arm is
foolish indeed.  This Charm allows the character to perfectly defend against
any form of natural or unnatural mental influence which would otherwise bypass
his defenses.  He will gain a vague impression of the intended influence, but
not the details.  Furthermore, as a counterattack, the originator of the
effect will herself be subjected to an Illusion causing her to believe that
her attack was successful.  The Illusion lasts as long as the original effect
would have, and may be resisted on the same terms as the original effect.
Since this Charm involves both resisting and imposing mental influence at the
same time, the character gains a point each of both Hodge and Podge.


name: sdc, Subtle Daydream Concoction
cost: 6m
mins: Integrity 3, Ess 3
type: Reflexive (Step 2)
key: Combo-Basic, Shaping
dur: Instant
dep: ddt

text: Some have said that the Erisian Exalted live in a world of their own;
the truth is that this can be an advantage.  This Charm allows the user to
seek the refuge of daydreams to sidestep attempts to pull her away from that
which is important to her.  It can be invoked in response to any attack which
would lower Virtues or Willpower, or destroy or weaken Intimacies, or cause
her to act against her Intimacies or Motivation.

In the case of natural mental influence, the Exalt may make a contested roll
of her own (Essence + Integrity) against the (Attribute + Ability) used to
achieve the influence and, on success, treat it as an unacceptable order.  For
unnatural mental influence the contest is between their (Essence + Integrity)
and the (Essence + Ability) of the Charm used (or caster's [Essence + Occult]
for spells), but the character suffers a penalty equal to the difference in
Essence, minimum 1.  In either case, if she fails the roll she may still spend
Willpower to resist the effect, if applicable.  If she botches the roll, she
is automatically affected and for the rest of the scene cannot spend Willpower
to resist that one effect.

Similarly, if some effect threatens to directly lower any of the character's
Virtues or her Willpower, temporarily or permanently, she may make the same
contested roll to avoid the effect.  Furthermore, if one of the Fair Folk
attempts to feed on the character she may use this Charm to fool her attacker,
even if she is willing or influenced to accept the raksha's feeding.  The
normal Virtue roll to feed is contested against the victim's own (Essence +
Integrity).  The latter successes are subtracted from those for the Virtue
roll, reducing the damage the feeder does.  If the Virtue successes are
outnumbered by those from the (Essence + Integrity) roll, then the Fair One
believes themselves to have bled off that many dots of Willpower or Virtue and
will account their Essence accordingly, meaning that they may be surprised to
find it run out sooner than they expected.

In any case, if the character succeeds against the attack, she will gain a
clear sense of what influence the attacker intended, should she wish to play
out her supposedly altered state.  Effects which prevent Shaping render this
Charm inapplicable.  Use of this Charm gains the character a point of Podge.

[TODO: Why isn't this a Counterattack + Illusion, like the preceding Charm?]

text: They Who Carve Truth In Stone are able to form that metaphorical stone
from the gossamer of daydreams, convincing herself that her view of the world
is the only right one, if only for a short while.  This Charm perfectly
defends against any Compulsion, Emotion, Illusion, Servitude and Shaping
attacks for the rest of the scene.  Additionally, any compulsions due to lack
of Willpower, or an overflowing of Hodge or Podge, are delayed until the end
of the scene.  On the other hand, any attempts by the character to act against
her Virtues, Intimacies or Motivation have their difficulties increased by 2.
Use of this Charm gains the character a point of Podge but, if that takes the
count over 10, the consequences are still delayed until the end of the scene.

type: Permanent
key: None
dur: Permanent
dep:

text: TODO

Each purchase of this Charm permanently enhances the character by giving her
increasing her maximum temporary Willpower by 1 point.  This additional pool
of Willpower is initially empty and will not be refilled by Conviction rolls
each morning.  Instead it is filled by any other effect such as stunts and
Charms, and this extra pool will be filled before her normal Willpower pool.
This Charm may be purchased up to (Essence) times.

In times of dire need, this Charm has a further use.  The desperate Discordian
may reflexively sacrifice one purchase of this Charm to immediately refill her
(slightly smaller) Willpower pool completely, including any points available
from remaining purchases of this Charm.  The experience points originally
spent on the Charm are not regained, though it may be purchased again later.
Sacrificing the last purchase of this Charm in this way prevents the character
from using any Charms which have it as a prerequisite, directly or indirectly,
until she re-purchases it.

cost: 3m plus 3m per point of Willpower
mins: Integrity 3, Ess 2
type: Simple
key: Combo-OK, Obvious, Touch
dur: Instant
dep: roe

text: TODO

This Charm allows the Unbending Arm to transfer Willpower between himself and
another being.  The character may transfer a number of points up to his
permanent Essence, in either direction, at a cost of 4 motes per point.  If
the other being is unwilling, the character must make a successful attack to
touch it, and the two make a contested (Essence + Integrity) roll.  If the
Erisian wins, the transfer is in the desired direction, and he gains a point
of Podge.  If he fails, the direction is reversed, and he gains a point of
Hodge.  In the case of a tie, nothing happens, but the motes are spent.  In
any case, this Charm cannot reduce the character's temporary Willpower rating
below zero, nor increase the target's beyond its maximum.


name: pma, Policy-Molding*Arrogation

type: Simple
key: Social
dur: Indefinite
dep:

text: TODO

This Charm allows an agent of the Authority to instantly forge an Intimacy in
relation to the Policy of a social group.  This Intimacy must involve
supporting, opposing or changing in some particular way the Policy of that
group.  As long as the character maintains her commitment of motes, she treats
all natural or unnatural mental influence which would divert her from that
goal as an unacceptable order (which means no points of Podge are gained from
resisting it).  Furthermore, she is able to spend Willpower to channel her
base, unmodified Integrity, as if it were an equivalently-rated Virtue, in
support of this Intimacy.

The character may maintain a number of such additional Intimacies equal to her
Conviction.  The available channels of Integrity in each story are shared
among all these Intimacies.  Using this Charm to maintain three Intimacies
does not gain (Integrity x 3) opportunities to channel Integrity, only
(Integrity).

text: TODO

This Charm enhances the Discordian's power of self-determination, allowing her
to share it with others.  The benefits of any Integrity Charm which she uses
may be extended to up to (her permanent Essence) other willing beings, at a
surcharge of 2m per being.  If several such Charms are used in a Combo, the
surcharge is still paid only once per being.  In the case of Reallocation of
Resolve, the total numer of Willpower points gained or lost may be distributed
among the beneficiaries as the character chooses.

The beneficiaries must be within (Essence x 10) yards of the character, unless
they are the subject of an Intimacy or Motivation which she holds, in which
case there is no distance limit.  At Essence 4, the character can spend a
point of Willpower to extend these benefits to a social group of Magnitude up
to her Essence, at a surcharge of 5 motes per point of Magnitude, provided she
has an Intimacy or Motivation related to that group.

[TODO: Maybe also/instead a Charm which allows the character to prepare an
invokation of a Charm to protect a group, like Protection of Celestial Bliss?]
