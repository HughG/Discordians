text: The Children of Chaos are not really as all-knowing as they would sometimes like others to think, but they have surprising sources of information.  This Charm enhances a roll involving the Lore Ability by allowing the character to draw on the knowledge held in the environment and society around her.  The subject of the roll must be something about the character's physical surroundings, or something which is recorded in nearby books, memory crystals etc., or something generally known by people nearby.  The range depends on the character's Essence rating: at Essence 2, it is 100 yards; at 3, 1 mile; at 4, 10 miles, and so on.  The information sought must be something generally known or specifically recorded, so this Charm tends not to be of use in, for example, investigating crime scenes.

The effect of the Charm differs depending on whether or not the subject is something the character would reasonably be expected to know.  If not, this Charm allows the character to make a normal Lore roll, as if it were in fact within the character's experience.  If it is something the character might already know, this Charm reduces the difficulty by at least 1, and possibly by more at storyteller discretion.

The Charm may also be used to gain information applicable to a particular use of some other Ability, e.g., the best route through a mountain range (normally Survival) or the appropriate formalities in some court situation (normally Socialize).  In this case, each carry-over successes adds one bonus die to that subsequent roll.  The normal limits on dice added by Charms apply.

The character does not need to speak or read any languages in which the information is recorded, nor actually find a partcular book or person to consult.  This means that, for example, one of the Authority can enhance her chances of success in operating an ancient artifact simply by standing briefly in the middle of a relevant First Age library.
