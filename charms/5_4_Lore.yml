  The Children of Chaos are not really as all-knowing as they would
  sometimes like others to think, but they have surprising sources of
  information.  This Charm enhances a roll involving the Lore Ability by
  allowing the character to draw on the knowledge held in the environment and
  society around her.  The subject of the roll must be something about the
  character's physical surroundings, or something which is recorded in nearby
  books, memory crystals etc., or something generally known by people nearby.
  The range depends on the character's Essence rating: at Essence 2, it is 100
  yards; at 3, 1 mile; at 4, 10 miles, and so on.  The information sought must
  be something generally known or specifically recorded, so this Charm tends not
  to be of use in, for example, investigating crime scenes.
  
  The effect of the Charm differs depending on whether or not the subject is
  something the character would reasonably be expected to know.  If not, this
  Charm allows the character to make a normal Lore roll, as if it were in fact
  within the character's experience.  If it is something the character might
  already know, this Charm reduces the difficulty by at least 1, and possibly by
  more at storyteller discretion, to a minimum of zero.
  
  *[TODO 2012-02-01 RWG: Give examples of what would count as what level of
  difficulty reduction.  Maybe connect it with the "first age library" example
  below.]*
  
  The character does not need to speak or read any languages in which the
  information is recorded, nor actually find a partcular book or person to
  consult.  This means that, for example, one of the Authority can enhance her
  chances of success in operating an ancient artifact simply by standing briefly
  in the middle of a relevant First Age library.  Lastly, bear in mind that
  things which are generally known may not be correct.

  TODO
  
  This Charm allows the character to make a Lore roll on topics which are known,
  but not widely, in a given area.  The subject must be one about which the
  character could not otherwise validly make a Lore roll.  Such facts and
  figures may be actively-kept secrets, obscure trivia in libraries, or simply
  humdrum details of interest to few.  The information need not be written down,
  but it must be known, even instinctively, by a number beings of at least
  Magnitude 2, and of at least animal intelligence.
  
  The range follows the character's Essence rating as with Holographic Memory
  Modus.  The character need not share a common language with the beings which
  hold the desired information but, if not, it may be communicated less clearly,
  particularly if it comes from an animal-level intelligence.  Knowledge sought
  may include hypotheses, opinions, and other such uncertain "knowledge".  If
  different information is available from separate groups, the character will
  gain insight from only the smallest of them, or one chosen by the Storyteller
  if there are several of equivalent Magnitude.  As with its precursor,
  information from this Charm will accurately represent knowledge from nearby
  beings, but their knowledge may not be correct.

  The Priests of Discord change names almost as often as they change hats,
  and most often the true name of something really doesn't matter at all.  But
  there are times when it can be a distinct advantage to know with whom one is
  dealing.
  
  This Charm reveals the true name of the target, regardless of any disguises,
  Shaping, Fate effects or other concealments.  In the case of a roll-off, the
  character gains (Essence) extra successes.  It does not guarantee that the
  character can pronounce or write down that name, if they do not speak the
  langauge.  However, they will know the name if they encounter it again.  If
  the being has no true name, for example, in the case of a Deathlord, the
  character will learn that.
  
  If the target has ancestors who are anything other than extras, this Charm
  will additionally reveal those on the single most powerful lineage, going back
  (character's Essence) generations.

  This Charm allows the character to temporarily redirect someone's focus,
  adding up to (Essence) points of new Specialties across up to (Essence)
  traits.  The character can add at most three dots to each trait.  These dots
  do not count towards the usual three-dot limit on Specialties.  Dots can be
  added for a new Specialty in a trait for which the target already has
  Specialties, but cannot simply add dots to an existing Specialty.  Normally
  Lunar and Alchemical Exalted can only gain Specialties in Attributes, and
  other beings in Abilities, unless the being has somehow gained Specialties in
  some atypical kind of trait.  If the character or target knows any version of
  Idiosyncratic Interpretation of (Virtue), Specialty dots can be temporarily
  gained in any Virtue.

  TODO
  
  A roll of the character's (Lore + Essence) is compared against a difficulty of
  the target's Essence.  For willing targets, add dice equal to the target's own
  Essence.  If the character targets himself, the difficulty is reduced to one.
  
  Each success provides one point of temporary Ability increase for the target,
  which may be divided among up to (Essence) Abilities.  Any given Ability can
  be increased by at most one dot, and cannot be increased beyond the normal
  maximum for the target.  Extra successes beyond these limits are wasted.
  
  At Essence 4, the duration increases to (Essence) days per success on the
  roll, and the Charm gains the Training Keyword, meaning that, at the end of
  the Charm's duration, the target can spend experience to make some or all of
  the changes permanent, and may go into experience point debt to do so.
  However, this permanent training cannot raise an Ability beyond 4.  If the
  Shaping effect is undone or the Charm otherwise ends before experience is
  spent, this Training opportunity is lost.  At Essence 5 the duration increases
  to (Essence) weeks per success.

  TODO
  
  A roll of the character's (Lore + Essence) is compared against a difficulty of
  the target's Essence.  For willing targets, add dice equal to the target's own
  Essence.  If the character targets himself, the difficulty is reduced to one.
  
  Each success provides one point of mutation which the character may inflict on
  the target.  However, the mutation takes its outward appearance from the
  target's own sense of self, so he or she may choose cosmetic details.
  Specifically, this automatically removes the benefit of the Solars'
  Destiny-Manifesting Method, though it will not overcome direct defenses like
  Integrity-Protecting Prana, except when used on a willing target.  The
  mutations unfold smoothly through the target's being in a matter of moments,
  in a disturbing yet painless and aesthetically pleasing ripple, taking effect
  at the start of the target's next action.
  
  At Essence 4, the duration increases to (Essence) days per success on the
  roll, and the Charm gains the Training Keyword, meaning that, at the end of
  the Charm's duration, the target can spend experience to make some or all of
  the changes permanent, and may go into experience point debt to do so.  If the
  Shaping effect is undone or the Charm otherwise ends before experience is
  spent, this Training opportunity is lost.  At Essence 5 the duration increases
  to (Essence) weeks per success, and any Mutations taken on as Training have
  the potential to breed true.

  Once activated, this Charm reduces the effect on the character's anima of her
  spending Essence from her Peripheral pool.  The total number of motes spent in
  each action period is divided by two, rounded down, to a minimum of one, to
  determine its contribution to the level of Divisional mark and anima visibility.
  Obvious Charms remain so.  This does not increase the effective size of her
  mote pool.
  
  If the Chaos Child currently has motes and Willpower committed to make her
  appear as a mortal with no mote pool, using the ability innate to all
  Discordians, then this Charm itself does not contribute to anima visibility at
  all, and its duration increases to Indefinite.  In that case, when this Charm
  ends, the character's Divisional mark and anima immediately show at a level
  matching her currently level of expenditure from her Peripheral pool.  This
  may result in a totemic-level flare, even though she is not at that moment
  spending Essence.
  
  *[TODO: Maybe this and/or ERP should move into Occult, along with
  Anima-Supressing Intervention?  It already has a lot of Charms, but 2-3 are

  TODO
  
  This Charm transfers up to (Lore + Essence) motes between the character and
  the target, in either direction.  If the target has multiple Essence pools,
  such as the Personal and Peripheral pools of the Exalted, it chooses how many
  motes are drawn from or added to each pool.  Beings without an Essence pool
  are not valid targets for this Charm.
  
  If the target is unwilling, the character must make a successful attack roll
  to touch it, and the two make a contested (Essence + Lore) roll.  If the
  Erisian wins, the transfer is in the desired direction, and he gains a point
  of Podge.  If he fails, the direction is reversed, and he gains a point of
  Hodge.  In the case of a tie, nothing happens, but the motes are spent.  Used
  on a willing target, there is no contested roll and no gain of Hodge or Podge.
  
  In any case, this Charm cannot reduce either being's mote pool below zero, nor
  increase it beyond its maximum.
