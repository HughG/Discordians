text: Provides clear understanding of all departments and factions within the organisation, official and unofficial, identifying the true leaders of each.  This gives the character a bonus number of dice equal to (his permanent Essence) to subsequent Bureaucracy actions in the scene which relate to influencing one group, or altering tensions between groups.  Information on the leaders' identities is retained permanently, though leadership may change later.

text: With knowledge of the overt and covert roles and communication channels in an organisation, the Exalt is able to arrange for her own pet project to be achieved without drawing attention to it.  The maximum duration of the project in days is equal to the largest group size for a Magnitude one less than the organisation's size; for example, a bureaucracy of 200 is Magnitude 4, so the maximum duration would be 150 days (the largest size of a Magnitude 3 group), or a little over 5 months.  The maximum Resources which can be diverted without attracting attention is half the group's Magnitude, rounded up, but no more than the Resources available to the group itself.  Again for example, from this 200-strong office, Resources 2 could be diverted, assuming they commanded at least Resources 2 in the first place.

text: Whereas some would improve the efficiency of an organisation by directly reshaping it, the Discordian knows that the same ends can often be achieved simply by gently adjusting the goals of the individuals within it.  The Exalt subtly influences the organisation so that, despite still following selfish internal goals, its various parts effectively work much more successfully towards an overall aim.  The Charm supplements a dramatic action and gives a number of internal bonuses equal to the group's Magnitude.  Half of this bonus, rounded up, will be permanent, as a mysterious air of good feeling persists after the project.  The cumulative permanent bonus over repeated application of this Charm cannot exceed the Exalt's Essence, although the temporary bonus may.

text: The sometimes crazed notions of the Unbending Arm are nonetheless unusually compelling.  Using this Charm, the character communicates a new Policy to an organisation, the means depending on its magnitude and how widely spread it is.  It may be sufficient to talk directly to senior figures, or it may be necessary to send memos to each department.

The player rolls ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Bureaucracy + Essence) when stating the new mission and, if the successes exceed the leader's MDV, it takes this on as a temporary new Intimacy, to be urgently pursued to the best of its ability.  The leader of the unit may spend two points of Loyalty to resist this effect.  If the roll succeeds but the mission is in conflict with the group's Motivation, it loses a dot of Magnitude, and those lost immediately form a splinter group with the mission as their Motivation.  If the new goal is in line with the organisation's Motivation, then they will drop all other activities to pursue it, throwing financial and political caution to the winds (although not ignoring the need to eat and sleep -- work/life balance is important, y'know).

If persuaded departments are sufficiently distant from each other, the new mission will not actually affect them until they get word of it, and the Charm's duration does not begin for them until they do.  Spreading the mission to these departments will be one of the first priorities of the organisation.  However, if a message fails to reach within (Essence) days of it being sent, it will have lost its magic and be ignored on receipt.  This can result in even greater confusion as different departments act on the mission at different times.  There is still only a single roll to determine whether the mission is adopted, however.

text: The Bishops of Greyface enjoy spreading confusion, particularly around the fundamental issue, for an organisation, of exactly what it is supposed to be doing.  Employing this charm, the player rolls ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Bureaucracy + Essence) with a difficulty equal to the leader's MDV.  If successful, the organisation forgets its Motivation; it will not act against it (unless otherwise compelled) but neither will it act in support of it, with the leader likely to spend Loyalty points to resist external attempts to persuade the organisation to do so.  The leader may also spend Loyalty to resist or shake off this Illusion, however.  Spending one point lifts it for a single scene, and spending a cumulative total of three ends the effect.

An organisation affected by this Illusion is not completely paralysed.  It will still carry on minor day-to-day activities, giving the surface appearance of being functional.  It may also successfully carry out activities not related to its main Motivation.  Applying this Charm to small outposts of the Immaculate Order can be particularly amusing.

text: Every organisation needs a new challenge from time to time, and sometimes that challenge comes from within.  This Charm allows the Architect of this particular chaos to compel one individual within the group to attempt to form a separate group with a significantly different, though not diametrically opposed, Motivation.  The character has no control over who this rebel will be, or what mission they will choose.  The would-be coup leader gains a number of bonus dice equal to (the character's permanent Essence) towards a number of attempts up to (the new group's current Loyalty), to form this new group or draw supporters from the original group.  Thus, if the new leader is defeated in some exchange, and the new group's Loyalty reduced, it reduces the number of remaining chances to build a stable group.  The target of this Charm may resist this unnatural mental influence by spending a point of Willpower.

text: Confusion can be a gift, in the right hands; though, as ever, it is better to give than to receive.  This Charm can be used in social, bureaucratic or mass combat situations, against some organised unit.  It disrupts lines of communication and supply to make it harder for a target unit to achieve its goals.  The effects employed are extremely subtle, applying an external penalty of (character's permanent Essence) to any attempts to discover the source of the problem.

For social units, vital phrases are misunderstood, the right people can't be found, and important tasks are forgotten briefly.  Together, these amount to a -4 external penalty is applied to any attempts to get the group to work in an organised way in support of its Motivation or any of its Policies, for the next 24 hours.  After that, the penalty reduces by 1 each day until it returns to normal, or until the Leader spends a point of Loyalty to reassert control, in which case penalties vanish immediately.

Applied to a bureaucratic organisation it is even more effective, in a narrower way.  In relation to a chosen project, memos are lost, official seals break, key staff members fall ill and so on.  All this imposes a -4 external penalty to all its actions for the day and, once the scene has ended, the consequent confusion delays the project by (character's [Bureacuracy x Essence]) days.  A cumulative expenditure of (character's Bureacuracy) points of Loyalty by the leader can bring the project back on track sooner.

In a battle it is less effective, but still useful in the right situation.  It will cause a target unit to act as if it had 2 fewer Relays than it actually does (often provoking communications failure, leading to a -2 Drill penalty), and will remove 2 points of bonuses to Might, as supplies are lost, ammunition is delivered to the wrong units, and maintenance orders for Magitech are misdirected, causing them to work poorly, if at all.  These penalties vanish the next day.

text: So dedicated are the Priests of Eris to meddling with established order that they have elevated its practice to a level of refinement normally reserved for martial artists.  The Greyface Exalt brings forth an official-looking but nonsesical form, or improvises one from materials at hand, and meditates briefly on the futilty of filling it out, after which it disappears in a puff of smoke.  While this Charm is active, he adds half of the highest of his Backing, Contacts, Cult, Followers and Influence Backgrounds to his Dodge DV and Dodge MDV, as he bends strands of Fate to redirect possible injury into these larger structures.  The cost of all Bureaucracy Charms is reduced by (his permanent Essence), to a minimum of 1m, and the durations of any Dramatic Actions based on Bureaucracy (using Charms or not), started during that scene, are divided by (his permanent Essence).  Lastly, for the duration of the scene, the character may use any individual Martial Arts Charm, or Martial Arts Combo, as part of an impromptu Combo with any single Bureaucracy Charm, or Bureaucracy Combo, at the cost of an additional point of Willpower each time.  This is likely to be most useful with Excellencies, or with the more obscure Celestial Martial Arts.

text: Too often, those who serve a larger cause get caught up in that service and give it more credence than they give themselves; which is something to be taken advantage of.  This Charm causes an organistion to lose all record of a particular fact, or introduces a new "fact" into their archives and common understanding.  It must be activated in the presence of a member of the organisation, or in one of its offices, permanent or temporary.  The organisation must have a Magnitude of no more than the character's (Essence + Bureaucracy).  The datum added or removed must be about something external to the organisation; so, for example, an Erisian cannot make himself the new leader of the Immaculate Order.

Any member of the organisation who was in the process of dealing with that fact (if it disappeared) or a closely related subject (if it just appeared) may resist the effect as unnatural mental influence, at a cost of 1wp per scene, with the effect lifting (for them) once they have spend a cumulative total of 3wp.  If they resist, they will be certain of the original truth of the matter, even though many of their colleagues may be baffled by their strange opinion.  For those who cannot or fail to resist, they immediately come to believe the new truth.

Note that there is nothing preventing the organisation from subsequently correcting its observations and updating its records.  However, in the short term, this Charm can be remarkably useful for such tasks as escaping from the attentions of the Wyld Hunt.  Also, for information which is truly hard to discover, the organisation may never be able to re-learn the truth.

text: A word in the right butterfly-like ear can have unexpected effects far away.  This Charm supplements an attempt by the character to manipulate a single in-process decision within an organisation.  Its target is any single member of the organisation, no matter how lowly: the magic of the Charm will work its way toward the real decision-maker (who may or may not be the one officially in that role).

The character makes a contested ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Bureaucracy) roll against the target's (Intelligence + [Integrity or Bureaucracy]).  If it is directly in opposition to the group's Motivation, and the group's Magnitude exceeds the Exalt's Essence, the attempt automatically fails.  Mere Policies (Intimacies) do not afford this protection, however.  If successful, the decision will go the way the character desires.  As with the Record-Correction Maneuver, there is nothing to prevent the organisation from changing the decision later, depending on its Motivation and tendencies -- unless, of course, it's too late.  The decision will not be changed for at least (character's Essence) days, however.

This Charm is only effective upon decisions which the organisation was already intending to make.  It cannot force a group to decide to do something which had never crossed its collective mind.

text: Trying to maintain control of a large organisation is a wearing task, which is why the Children of Eris prefer to just jump to the top of the heap temporarily.  With this Charm, the hand of Authority takes control of an organisation for one scene.  The original Leader is supplanted and all members of the group will recognise the character as the woman in charge.  They are not blindly compelled to obey orders, but will generally accept even drastic changes in the Motivation of the group, for example, unless they have strong and very personal reasons not to.  Once the effect ends, all will be fully aware of what they have just done, although they probably won't understand why.

If the character attempts to use this Charm on a group more than once, any individuals who interacted with her on previous occasions may resist the effect as unnatural mental influence, at a cost of 2wp.
