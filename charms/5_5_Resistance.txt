text: Unpredictable as the followers of Eris are, you can never quite tell
when they're going to keel over in a fight.  A player may purchase this Charm
once for each dot of Resistance her character has.  Each purchase gains the
character one of the following combinations of additional health levels, at
the player's option, determined at the time of purchase: one -0 health level;
or one -1 health level and two -2 health levels; or one -2 health level and
three -4 health levels

This Charm allows the Discordian to take on the Hardness and soak of another
object or being with which he is in contact.  In the case of an object, it
must be one the character is firmly in conctact with: a floor he is standing
on, a door he is backed up against or the like.  Similarly in the case of
another being, the two must be engaged in a grapple or the character must be
firmly pressed against the other, perhaps voluntarily standing back-to-back,
perhaps lying on an Inactive "assistant".  In either case, the touched target
must be of reasonable size to absorb the blow: it is not enough for the
character to carry a small piece of stone in his pocket.

Solid objects generally have a Hardness equal to their soak, as described in
Exalted, pp. 153-154.  If touching another being, the relevant Hardness and
soak is taken from that being's armoured, if it is wearing any, otherwise from
its natural values (including any magical enhancements).  In either case, the
character's Hardness is set to the borrowed value, if it is not already
greater, while the soak he takes on is added to his natural soak.

This Charm is made Obvious by the fact that the character briefly comes to
resemble the source of his improved toughness.  For objects, his skin takes on
the appearance of the material.  If borrowing natural toughness from a creature,
his appearance momentarily changes to be a mix of his own and the other's.

This Charm allows the Discordian to transmit the force of an attack on him
into another object or being with which he is in contact.  Applicable objects
or beings are the same as those described for Stone Skin Substitution.

If the damage of the attack is sufficient to overcome the Hardness of the
other object or being, its full force is transmitted through the character and
into the other, which suffers the damage.  If not, the character suffers the
damage as normal, but the force rebounds on his attacker, unless it was a
ranged attack.  In that case the attacker must check for Knockdown if the
damage exceeds (attacker's Stamina + Resistance).  The character will feel
instinctively if his "cushion" has too great a Hardness to absorb the blow,
and may choose not to activate this Charm.

The character may also activate this Charm if subject to a magically-enhanced
Knockback effect which causes additional damage on impact, provided that
damage exceeds the Hardness of the object.  This usage does not affect the
damage of the original effect, only that of impact after Knockback.

This Charm protects the character against damage from attacks, and against
Crippling effects as a consequence of damage.  It will generally not protect
against other keyworded effects, and may not protect against certain Crippling
effects, depending on how they are inflicted.  Also, note that objects which
are to be the targets of transmitted damage must be sufficiently solid:
tapestries or water would not suffice, though sand and earth probably would.
If the instant or cumulative damage is enough to destroy the target of the
transmitted force, the character and other combatants may have to make
Athletics checks, suffer environmental damage or otherwise deal with the
consequences.

This Charm perfectly absorbs the effects of any physical attack, reducing the
raw damage to zero after all other effects.  The defense is achieved by a
concentration of Erisian Essence at the relevant points of contact, so it is
accompanied by a vivid manifestation of such.  This will not be enough to
cause any damage or significantly distract attackers, but a clever description
may pave the way for later stunts.

[TODO: Need an FoI, and maybe more flavour.  Could extend environmental
destruction of previous Charm to be a limited form of FoI?  Makes defending
other things/people harder.]

[TODO: Maybe, at higher Essence and/or with repurchase, spend +1wp to impose
external penalty on others for next action due to Erisian Essence
manifestation?]

For every mote she spends beyond the first two, this Charm heals one level of
bashing damage from the character, or converts one level of lethal to bashing.
This is achieved by co-opting materials from her surroundings to fill the
gaps, and any non-magical materials not owned by anyone may be pressed into
service.  The amount extracted will never be enough to cause damage to other
objects.  If the character has regained more than (Essence) health levels
through this Charm, the repairs themselves start to become Obvious and her
appearance may become somewhat odd, even bizarre.  When activated in realms
beyond Creation, the possible results expand even further.

The replacement materials will be expelled from her system as normal wound
healing time elapses, and medical attention or magics may reduce this time as
normal.  Until that point, anti-Shaping effects which target the character
will undo the repairs, causing the full effects of the original wounds to
return.

This Charm is similar to the Elemental Charm known as Elemental
Rejuvenation. To use it, the character must be in contact with a powerful
manifestation of the Erisian element associated with his Division or
Parametadivision.  While it is active, the Chosen of Eris either heals one
health level of damage every five ticks, or regains one point of Willpower
every 23 minutes (i.e., 7 points every 6 hours), the choice being made when
the Charm is activated.  However, this requires the character's full
attention, so he is Inactive, though still aware of his surroundings.  He may
choose to end the Charm reflexively at any time, whereupon he can act on the
following action.

The question of whether something consists of one of the Elements described in
Discordian Doctrine is really one of viewpoint and belief, so the storyteller
may require a descriptive stunt to justify use of this Charm.  If so, an
insufficient stunt might result in the duration between benefits being doubled
or tripled, or the Charm failing to activate at all.  If the stunt is judged
sufficient, the normal stunt benefits, of regaining Essence or Willpower, are
not available.

This Charm allows the character to adapt himself to avoid all damage from any
one poison.  As long as the necessary motes are committed to this Charm, each
interval which would require a Stamina + Resistance passes without damage, but
still allows the substance to gradually leave his system.  The Charm only
prevents damage; it does not prevent any penalties if the character has
received more doses than his tolerance for the substance allows.

Until the poison has run its course, the character treats any other substance
as if it were equally poisonous, including water.  For fast-acting poisons
this may not be a problem, but the targeted poison does not necessarily
provide nourishment so, for slower toxins, the character may starve if
untreated.  This Charm may be activated multiple times for separate poisons,
in which case all are equally palatable.  Thus a character may attempt to wean
himself off onto alcohol and survive with no more than a bad hangover, if no
other treatment is unavailable.

This Charm must be activated at the moment the poison enters the character's
system for it to be effective.

This Charm allows one of the Unbending Arm to bend his mind to keep his body
straight.  Any one Sickness effect which would harm the character may be
transformed into a sickness of the heart, severely changing the tone of one of
his Intimacies.  The character chooses the Intimacy to be affected and can
propose the new tone, though the Storyteller must agree that the change puts
the character at a significant disadvantage.  Once the sickness has been cured
or run its course, the Charm ends and the Intimacy is restored, unless it has
been removed in the meantime.  The character cannot work to erode the Intimacy
while it carries the Sickness, though others may.  If the Erisian allows the
commitment of motes to lapse prematurely, the Intimacy is restored, but the
Sickness returns to run whatever remains of its natural course.

This Charm must be activated at the moment the illness enters the character's
system for it to be effective.

This Charm allows a Stone-Carver to prevent himself from being carved up.
Activated in response to a Crippling effect, this Charm allows him to transfer
the destruction to any one of his Abilities which is rated 1 or more.  As long
as the motes remain committed to this Charm, the Crippling effect is held at
bay, but the character's rating in that Ability is treated as zero.  This does
not prevent the character from using any Charms he knows which require a
rating in that Ability, but it does disable any Charm effects which are
conditional on a particular rating, typically worded as "at Essence 3+" or "a
further purchase at Essence 4".  Specialties are unavailable, though
Excellencies can still be spent on rolls.

This Charm must be activated at the moment the character suffers a crippling
wound, for it to be effective.  When the motes are released, the character's
Ability rating returns to normal, but the Crippling would takes effect, unless
suitable medical treatment has been given.  The character can alternatively
spend 3xp, as if raising the Ability from 0 to 1.  This does not raise the
Ability but immediately heals the wound.
