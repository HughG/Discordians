This Charm allows the Discordian to take on the Hardness and soak of another
object or being with which he is in contact.  In the case of an object, it
must be one the character is firmly in conctact with: a floor he is standing
on, a door he is backed up against or the like.  Similarly in the case of
another being, the two must be engaged in a grapple or the character must be
firmly pressed against the other, perhaps voluntarily standing back-to-back,
perhaps lying on an Inactive "assistant".  In either case, the touched target
must be of reasonable size to absorb the blow: it is not enough for the
character to carry a small piece of stone in his pocket.

Solid objects generally have a Hardness equal to their soak, as described in
Exalted, pp. 153-154.  If touching another being, the relevant Hardness and
soak is taken from that being's armoured, if it is wearing any, otherwise from
its natural values (including any magical enhancements).  In either case, the
character's Hardness is set to the borrowed value, if it is not already
greater, while the soak he takes on is added to his natural soak.

This Charm is made Obvious by the fact that the character briefly comes to
resemble the source of his improved toughness.  For objects, his skin takes on
the appearance of the material.  If borrowing natural toughness from a creature,
his appearance momentarily changes to be a mix of his own and the other's.

This Charm allows the Discordian to transmit the force of an attack on him
into another object or being with which he is in contact.  Applicable objects
or beings are the same as those described for Stone Skin Substitution.

If the damage of the attack is sufficient to overcome the Hardness of the
other object or being, its full force is transmitted through the character and
into the other, which suffers the damage.  If not, the character suffers the
damage as normal, but the force rebounds on his attacker, unless it was a
ranged attack.  In that case the attacker must check for Knockdown if the
damage exceeds (attacker's Stamina + Resistance).  The character will feel
instinctively if his "cushion" has too great a Hardness to absorb the blow,
and may choose not to activate this Charm.

The character may also activate this Charm if subject to a magically-enhanced
Knockback effect which causes additional damage on impact, provided that
damage exceeds the Hardness of the object.  This usage does not affect the
damage of the original effect, only that of impact after Knockback.

This Charm protects the character against damage from attacks, and against
Crippling effects as a consequence of damage.  It will generally not protect
against other keyworded effects, and may not protect against certain Crippling
effects, depending on how they are inflicted.  Also, note that objects which
are to be the targets of transmitted damage must be sufficiently solid:
tapestries or water would not suffice, though sand and earth probably would.
If the instant or cumulative damage is enough to destroy the target of the
transmitted force, the character and other combatants may have to make
Athletics checks, suffer environmental damage or otherwise deal with the
consequences.

This Charm is similar to the Elemental Charm known as Elemental
Rejuvenation. To use it, the character must be in contact with a powerful
manifestation of the Erisian element associated with his Division or
Parametadivision.  While it is active, the Chosen of Eris either heals one
health level of damage every five ticks, or regains one point of Willpower
every 23 minutes (i.e., 7 points every 6 hours), the choice being made when
the Charm is activated.  However, this requires the character's full
attention, so he is Inactive, though still aware of his surroundings.  He may
choose to end the Charm reflexively at any time, whereupon he can act on the
following action.

The question of whether something consists of one of the Elements described in
Discordian Doctrine is really one of viewpoint and belief, so the storyteller
may require a descriptive stunt to justify use of this Charm.  If so, an
insufficient stunt might result in the duration between benefits being doubled
or tripled, or the Charm failing to activate at all.  If the stunt is judged
sufficient, the normal stunt benefits, of regaining Essence or Willpower, are
not available.

This Charm allows the character to temporarily reallocate one or more dots
from her Attributes or Abilities to make up for lost Health levels.  When the
Charm is activated, any number of dots may be transferred from any combination
of Attributes or Abilities, including any connected Specialties.  Each dot of
an Ability or Specialty effectively heals one dot of bashing or lethal damage,
while each dot of an Attribute counts for two, or a single dot of aggravated
damage.

As each Health level heals, the corresponding Trait dots become available
again, in whatever order suits the character.  Once all are healed, the Charm
ends.  The character may choose to terminate the Charm at any time, in which
case all Health levels not yet healed take their toll on her immediately.  She
can activate it again if she suffers further damage, but cannot activate it in
advance of being injured.  Anti-Shaping effects which target the character can
also cause the Charm to end prematurely.

Traits lowered by this Charm cannot be raised by spending experience while it
is in effect, though they can be augmented by other temporary means.  Any
Charms or other effects which require certain Trait minimums may become
temporarily unavailable while this Charm is in effect.

[TODO: Is this just dumb?  Should it allow "active when Inactive"?  Should I
have a follow-on which heals without stupid side-effects?]

This Charm allows the character to adapt himself to avoid all damage from any
one poison.  As long as the necessary motes are committed to this Charm, each
interval which would require a Stamina + Resistance passes without damage, but
still allows the substance to gradually leave his system.  The Charm only
prevents damage; it does not prevent any penalties if the character has
received more doses than his tolerance for the substance allows.

Until the poison has run its course, the character treats any other substance
as if it were equally poisonous, including water.  For fast-acting poisons
this may not be a problem, but the targeted poison does not necessarily
provide nourishment so, for slower toxins, the character may starve if
untreated.  This Charm may be activated multiple times for separate poisons,
in which case all are equally palatable.  Thus a character may attempt to wean
himself off onto alcohol and survive with no more than a bad hangover, if no
other treatment is unavailable.

This Charm must be activated at the moment the poison enters the character's
system for it to be effective.

This Charm allows one of the Unbending Arm to bend his mind to keep his body
straight.  Any one Sickness effect which would harm the character may be
transformed into a sickness of the heart, severely changing the tone of one of
his Intimacies.  The character chooses the Intimacy to be affected and can
propose the new tone, though the Storyteller must agree that the change puts
the character at a significant disadvantage.  Once the sickness has been cured
or run its course, the Charm ends and the Intimacy is restored, unless it has
been removed in the meantime.  The character cannot work to erode the Intimacy
while it carries the Sickness, though others may.  If the Erisian allows the
commitment of motes to lapse prematurely, the Intimacy is restored, but the
Sickness returns to run whatever remains of its natural course.

This Charm must be activated at the moment the illness enters the character's
system for it to be effective.
