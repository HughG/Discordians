text: Unpredictable as the followers of Eris are, you can never quite tell
when they're going to keel over in a fight.  A player may purchase this Charm
once for each dot of Resistance her character has.  Each purchase gains the
character one of the following combinations of additional health levels, at
the player's option, determined at the time of purchase: one -0 health level;
or one -1 health level and two -2 health levels; or one -2 health level and
three -4 health levels

This Charm allows the Discordian to transmit the force of an attack on him
into another object or being with which he is in contact.  In the case of an
object, it must be one the character is firmly in conctact with: a floor he is
standing on, a door he is backed up against or the like.  Similarly in the
case of another being, the two must be engaged in a grapple or the character
must be firmly pressed against the other, perhaps voluntarily standing
back-to-back, perhaps lying on an Inactive "assistant".

If the damage of the attack is sufficient to overcome the Hardness of the
other object or being, its full force is transmitted through the character and
into the other, which suffers the damage.  If not, the character suffers the
damage as normal, but the force rebounds on his attacker, unless it was a
ranged attack.  In that case the attacker must check for Knockdown if the
damage exceeds (attacker's Stamina + Resistance).  The character will feel
instinctively if his "cushion" has too great a Hardness to absorb the blow,
and may choose not to activate this Charm.  Solid objects generally have a
Hardness equal to their soak, as described in Exalted, pp. 151-152.

The character may also activate this Charm if subject to a magically-enhanced
Knockback effect which causes additional damage on impact, provided that
damage exceeds the Hardness of the object.  This usage does not affect the
damage of the original effect, only that of impact after Knockback.


This Charm protects the character against damage from attacks, and against
Crippling effects as a consequence of damage.  It will generally not protect
against other keyworded effects, and may not protect against certain Crippling
effects, depending on how they are inflicted.  Also, note that objects which
are to be the targets of transmitted damage must be sufficiently solid:
tapestries or water would not suffice, though sand and earth probably would.
If the instant or cumulative damage is enough to destroy the target of the
transmitted force, the character and other combatants may have to make
Athletics checks, suffer environmental damage or otherwise deal with the
consequences.

This Charm is similar to the Elemental Charm known as Elemental
Rejuvenation. To use it, the character must be in contact with a powerful
manifestation of the Erisian element associated with his Division or
Parametadivision.  While it is active, the Chosen of Eris either heals one
health level of damage every five ticks, or regains one point of Willpower
every 23 minutes (i.e., 7 points every 6 hours), the choice being made when
the Charm is activated.  However, this requires the character's full
attention, so he is Inactive, though still aware of his surroundings.  He may
choose to end the Charm reflexively at any time, whereupon he can act on the
following action.

The question of whether something consists of one of the Elements described in
Discordian Doctrine is really one of viewpoint and belief, so the storyteller
may require a descriptive stunt to justify use of this Charm.  If so, an
insufficient stunt might result in the duration between benefits being doubled
or tripled, or the Charm failing to activate at all.  If the stunt is judged
sufficient, the normal stunt benefits, of regaining Essence or Willpower, are
not available.
