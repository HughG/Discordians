  Unpredictable as the followers of Eris are, you can never quite tell when
  they're going to keel over in a fight.  A player may purchase this Charm
  once for each dot of Resistance her character has.  Each purchase gains the
  character one of the following combinations of additional health levels, at
  the player's option, determined at the time of purchase: one -0 health
  level; or one -1 health level and two -2 health levels; or one -2 health
  level and three -4 health levels

  TODO
  
  This Charm allows the Discordian to take on the Hardness and soak of another
  object or being with which he is in contact.  In the case of an object, it
  must be one the character is firmly in conctact with: a floor he is standing
  on, a door he is backed up against or the like.  Similarly in the case of
  another being, the two must be engaged in a grapple or the character must be
  firmly pressed against the other, perhaps voluntarily standing back-to-back,
  perhaps lying on an Inactive ``assistant''.  In either case, the touched
  target must be of reasonable size to absorb the blow: it is not enough for
  the character to carry a small piece of stone in his pocket.
  
  Solid objects generally have a Hardness equal to their soak, as described in
  Exalted, pp. 153-154.  If touching another being, the relevant Hardness and
  soak is taken from that being's armor, if it is wearing any, otherwise from
  its natural values (including any magical enhancements).  In either case,
  the character's Hardness is set to the borrowed value, if it is not already
  greater, while the soak he takes on is added to his natural soak.
  
  This Charm is made Obvious by the fact that the character briefly comes to
  resemble the source of his improved toughness.  For objects, his skin takes
  on the appearance of the material.  If borrowing natural toughness from a
  creature, his appearance momentarily changes to be a mix of his own and the
  other's.

  TODO
  
  This Charm allows the Discordian to transmit the force of an attack on him
  into another object or being with which he is in contact.  Applicable
  objects or beings are the same as those described for Stone Skin
  Substitution.
  
  The character suffers at most minimum damage (usually, the attacker's
  Essence in dice), while the receiving object suffers full damage.  If the
  damage is insufficient to overcome the Hardness of the object then the force
  rebounds.  If the attack is hand-to-hand rather than ranged, then the
  attacker must check for Knockdown if the damage exceeds (attacker's Stamina
  + Resistance).
  
  The character may also activate this Charm if subject to a
  magically-enhanced Knockback effect which causes additional damage on
  impact.  This usage does not affect the damage of the original effect, only
  that of impact after Knockback.
  
  This Charm protects the character against damage from attacks, and against
  Crippling effects as a consequence of damage.  It will generally not protect
  against other keyworded effects, and may not protect against certain
  Crippling effects, depending on how they are inflicted.  Also, note that
  objects which are to be the targets of transmitted damage must be
  sufficiently solid: tapestries or water would not suffice, though sand and
  earth probably would.  If the instant or cumulative damage is enough to
  destroy the target of the transmitted force, the character and other
  combatants may have to make Athletics checks, suffer environmental damage or
  otherwise deal with the consequences.

  TODO
  
  This Charm perfectly absorbs the effects of any physical attack, reducing
  the raw damage to zero after all other effects.  The defense is achieved by
  a concentration of Erisian Essence at the relevant points of contact, so it
  is accompanied by a vivid manifestation of such.  This will not be enough to
  cause any damage or significantly distract attackers, but a clever
  description may pave the way for later stunts.

  TODO
  
  For two motes she spends, this Charm heals one level of bashing damage from
  the character, up to a maximum of (Essence) levels.  At Essence 3, the
  character can instead choose to convert one level of lethal to bashing for
  every two motes spent.  The character cannot heal lethal damage completely
  without activating this Charm twice, in a flurry or on separate actions.
  
  The healing is achieved by co-opting materials from her surroundings to fill
  the gaps, and any non-magical materials not owned by anyone may be pressed
  into service.  The amount extracted will never be enough to cause damage to
  other objects.  If the character has regained more than (Essence) health
  levels through this Charm, the repairs themselves start to become Obvious
  and her appearance may become somewhat odd, even bizarre.  When activated in
  realms beyond Creation, the possible results expand even further.
  
  The replacement materials will be expelled from her system as normal wound
  healing time elapses, and medical attention or magics may reduce this time
  as normal.

  TODO
  
  This Charm is similar to the Elemental Charm known as Elemental
  Rejuvenation. To use it, the character must be in contact with a powerful
  manifestation of the Erisian element associated with his Division or
  Parametadivision.  While it is active, the Chosen of Eris either heals one
  health level of damage every five ticks, or regains one point of Willpower
  every 23 minutes (i.e., 7 points every 6 hours), the choice being made when
  the Charm is activated.  In the case of healing damage, bashing is healed
  first, then lethal, then aggravated.  However, this requires the character's
  full attention, so he is Inactive, though still aware of his surroundings.
  He may choose to end the Charm reflexively at any time, whereupon he can act
  on the following action.
  
  The question of whether something consists of one of the Elements described
  in Discordian Doctrine is really one of viewpoint and belief, so the
  storyteller may require a descriptive stunt to justify use of this Charm.
  If so, an insufficient stunt might result in the duration between benefits
  being doubled or tripled, or the Charm failing to activate at all.  If the
  stunt is judged sufficient, the normal stunt benefits, of regaining Essence
  or Willpower, are not available.

  TODO
  
  This Charm protects against various forms of damage to the character by
  redirecting it into some other aspect of his being.  It comes in three
  variants; the character chooses one when initially purchasing this Charm,
  and can buy the others later for half the normal Charm cost.  The character
  can stack any number of activations of one or more variants.  In all cases,
  the Charm must be activated at the moment the keyworded effect applies for
  it to be effective.
  
  /Tasty Poison Adaptation/: As long as motes are committed to this Charm,
  each interval which would require a Stamina + Resistance passes without
  damage, but still allows the substance to gradually leave his system.  The
  Charm only prevents damage; it does not prevent any penalties if the
  character has received more doses than his tolerance for the substance
  allows.  Until the poison has run its course, the character treats any other
  substance as if it were as poisonous as the unmitigated toxin, including
  water.  For fast-acting poisons this may not be a problem, but the targeted
  poison does not necessarily provide nourishment so, for slower toxins, the
  character may starve if untreated.  If no other treatment for the original
  poison is available, a common approach is for a character to re-activate it
  for alcohol, wean himself off onto that, and survive with no more than a bad
  hangover.
  
  /Soul-Sickness Transfer/: Any one Sickness effect which would harm the
  character may be transformed into a sickness of the heart, severely changing
  the tone of one of his Intimacies.  The character chooses the Intimacy to be
  affected and can propose the new tone, though the Storyteller must agree
  that the change puts the character at a significant disadvantage.  Once the
  sickness has been cured or run its course, the Charm ends and the Intimacy
  is restored, unless it has been removed in the meantime.  The character
  cannot work to erode the Intimacy while it carries the Sickness, though
  others may.  If the Erisian allows the commitment of motes to lapse
  prematurely, the Intimacy is restored, but the Sickness returns to run
  whatever remains of its natural course.
  
  /Puissance as Poultice/: Activated in response to a Crippling effect, this
  Charm allows the character to transfer the destruction to any one of his
  Abilities which is rated 1 or more.  As long as the motes remain committed
  to this Charm, the Crippling effect is held at bay, but the character's
  rating in that Ability is treated as zero.  This does not prevent the
  character from using any Charms he knows which require a rating in that
  Ability, but it does disable any Charm effects which are conditional on a
  particular rating, typically worded as ``at Archery 3+'' or ``a further
  purchase at Lore 4''.  Specialties are unavailable, though Excellencies can
  still be spent on rolls, still treating the Ability rating as zero for the
  purpose of dice caps.  When the motes are released, the character's Ability
  rating returns to normal, but the Crippling wound takes effect unless
  suitable medical treatment has been given.  The character can alternatively
  spend 3 experience points, as if raising the Ability from 0 to 1.  This does
  not raise the Ability but immediately heals the wound.

  The chosen of Eris are not immune to Chaos, but they have a deeper
  understanding of it than others.  This Charm allows the character to alter
  the consequences of a Shaping effect when it is successfully applied to him.
  For Wyld mutations, they may alter the severity level by one in either
  direction (including choosing to completely ignore the least severe
  mutations).  For other Shaping effects which numerically alter some trait,
  they may adjust the value by one, again in either direction.  For Shaping
  effects which do not fall into these categories, the player may agree some
  appropriate adjustment with the storyteller.

  The Bishops of Greyface do not gladly suffer Chaos when it gets in their
  way.  With this Charm the character may undo any one Shaping effect which
  has altered her at any point in time.  If the Shaping affected more
  individuals than just the character, she will be the only one to escape it.
  A ghostly rainbow outline of the character will persist, hanging in space
  for one scene, embodying that sloughed-off magic.  If any other being
  touches it before the scene expires, the original effect is immediately
  applied to them, though they may use any powers of their own to resist it.
  
  If the character is attuned to a Fair Folk adjuration, each use of this
  Charm disables one of the mutations it confers.  Once all mutations have
  been disabled, she is no longer attuned to the artifact, regardless of
  whether or not she has fulfilled or broken the oath.

  TODO
  
  This Charm makes the character master of his own shape, though it does not
  make it inviolable.  If any effect would prevent the character from applying
  a Shaping effect to himself, he is nonetheless able to do so.  This is true
  whether the effect targets the character specifically or is one which
  affects an area he is in.  If any effect specifically contests this Charm,
  add the character's Essence in automatic successes to the roll-off.
