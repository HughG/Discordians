  Style based on balance of power.  Celestial level, pushing the boundaries
  towards Sidereal.  Counterattacks, flurry-breakers, dual Knockback(?),
  mimicing opponent.

  Should be a full fighting style, 7-8 Charms.

  RWG says: look at 2.5 version of Solar Hero, Violet Bier of Sorrows and
  Infernal Monster.  Enhanced effects probably shouldn't be as powerful, but
  straight powers can be, because they're open to all CMA users.

  * Instant-on Form condition: if attacked when not wearing armor or wielding
  a weapon?

  * On Join Battle, match best roll across all opponents (but excluding
  allies).  Character does not roll, so cannot get better than opponents.

  * Attack as if wielding the same weapon as any one opponent.  Doesn't gain
  unique artifact powers, but does include magical material bonuses?  RWG
  points out you'd have to be careful that the character didn't gain bonuses
  without also gaining penalties that the opponent had, e.g., from mote
  commitments, weapon drawbacks etc.

  * Soak as if wearing the same armor as any one opponent.  Doesn't gain
  unique artifact powers, but does include magical material bonuses?  Same
  caveats as with weapons.

  * Add to soak based on further non-weapon bonuses which one opponent has.
  Maybe only add, say, half the difference?

  * Automatic Counterattack; action-long or scene-long -- but I have quite a
  few already.

  * Using weapon and armor stats in unusual ways, e.g., using Damage of
  improvised weapon as extra soak, with the weapon maybe being destroyed; or
  attacking with armor.

  Native non-Style MA follow-on Charms which add things like use of Elsewhere
  to bypass armor, or to give a perfect dodge which applies only to
  non-area-effect attacks, by making an Elsewhere "hole" through the
  character.

  Every journey begins with a first step, be the ground mud, grass or
  brass.  The martial artist acknowledges her mortal passions, and begins to see
  that the focus of the form comes not from repressing them, but from mastering
  them knack of opening them up to inspiration from higher powers.
  
  If the character channels a Virtue on a stunted Martial Arts action which is
  successful, she may role the same number of Virtue dice again, with each
  success adding one points of Essence to the reward from the stunt.
  Alternatively she may regain half that many points of Willpower, rounded up.
  In addition, the character regains one channel of any one Virtue at the end of
  the scene.  She cannot regain more than one Virtue channel through use of this
  Charm, regardless of how many times she uses it in a scene.

  Having gained a deeper understanding of his mortal self, the martial
  artist takes the next step and learns how to better channel his Essence into
  concrete actions.
  
  For the remainder of the scene, the character may add one to his Essence
  rating in all calculations based on it (not only Martial Arts actions).  This
  does not allow him to access new Charms, nor to access facets of Charm effects
  which require a certain minumum Essence.  For instance, it does not allow an
  Essence 2 character to extend the benefits of [Hod] or [Netzah] to other
  characters, but it does allow an Essence 3 character to extend them to /two/
  allies.
  
  In addition, he may reflexively pay 1 mote to add one to his Martial Arts
  rating, in all calculations based on it, on any one action tick.  This does
  not apply for reflexive (most likely defensive) calculations taken on the
  ticks between actions.  The increase in Martial Arts rating explicitly /does/
  raise the dice cap for excellencies.  As with the Essence increase, it does
  not allow the character access to new Charms or new facets thereof.

  The Anchorite gathers his strength, from his own mortal body and from
  the Essence which flows into him, preparing to pass judgement on his enemy.
  Onlookers will see no glowing sparks around him, but his mien takes on a
  transcendent might and righteousness, which is obvious to all.
  
  The Priest of Eris invokes this Charm to supplement a Aim action, converting
  up to (the higher of [Essence or Temperance]) bonus dice to successes on the
  subsequent attack (if any).
  
  For each point of Essence above 2, she may reflexively add the bonus dice (not
  as successes) from her Aim action to the next attack by any one ally within
  (Essence x 5) yards, provided that attack is on the same target and occurs
  before the character's next action.  These dice count towards that ally's
  limit on dice added by Charms for that attack.

  To strike down your enemy is a kindness, for surely he is in the wrong,
  and must learn this.
  
  The Law-man supplements his attack with this Charm, giving it the Knockback
  keyword.  For the purposes of the Knockback check, he adds his Valor in
  automatic successes to its damage, and adds (Valor รท 2), rounded up, to the
  difficulty of the target's roll.
  
  If the target is knocked back, the attack does no damage.  Furthermore, for
  each point of Essence above 2 which the character possesses, he may use his
  victory as inspiration and reflexively allow any one ally within (Essence x 5)
  yards to channel Valor on their next attack, without it counting towards the
  per-story limit on Virtue channeling.  These allies must still spend Willpower
  to channel Valor in this way.

  Mortals must struggle their way through life, earning their keep; yet at
  times unlooked-for, a higher source may empower them, out of recognition of
  their character and struggle.  Enlightenment, apotheosis and exaltation are
  powerful examples of this principle, but it applies on a smaller scale also.
  
  The martial artist adopts a meditative pose, symbolic of the connection from
  the highest power to the lowest, from Chaos to Order, yet remains ready to
  strike in an instant.  When she adopts this form, the character brings raw
  Essence and constructed reality into balance within herself.
  
  While this form is active, the character adds the highest of her Virtue
  ratings to her DVs and MDVs, and half that rating to any Martial Arts attack
  which is unarmed or uses form weapons.  In addition, a successful 2-die stunt
  will heal a single level of bashing damage, or convert a single level of
  lethal to bashing; and a successful three-die stunt will heal a single level
  of lethal, or convert a single aggravated level to lethal.  The character may
  forgo the normal stunt bonus to double this healing.

  Lesser fighters focus on defeating their enemies; those who grow in
  understanding see that one may win by simply ignoring those who are unworthy
  opponents.
  
  This Charm lays a Compulsion on all who have Joined Battle against the
  character in the current scene, to stay at least (Essence x Conviction) yards
  away from the character, and to move outside that range if they are currently
  within it.  The effect costs one Willpower to resist, which gains the
  character a point of Hodge.  (The character cannot gain more than one point of
  Hodge from a single activation of this Charm, no matter how many enemies
  resist.)  Opponents within the radius who do not resist experience this
  Compulsion physically, as if a successful Knockback had landed them just
  outside the range.  The Compulsion does not prevent opponents from using
  ranged attackings from outside the radius of effect.
  
  The effect ends prematurely, for an individual target, if the character
  attacks that target.  Anyone within the range who was not subject to the
  Compulsion (either because they were not a target or because they immediately
  resisted it) is bolstered by the perception that they are among the worthy.
  This includes the character himself.  At the end of the effect, they may roll
  their Conviction to regain Willpower as if they had enjoyed a night's sleep.
  This opportunity is lost to them if they attack any compelled targets before
  the effect ends; it is lost to all if the character attacks in this manner.

  The brave of heart find joy in combat, but the bright of heart seek only
  to bring joy and peace to others; to them, combat and conflict are true
  Anathema.
  
  When this Charm is activated, a glow of colorless Essence gathers around the
  Ignorant Child, then washes out around him.  This glow heals one level of
  bashing damage per mote spent, or converts one level of lethal to bashing per
  2 motes spent, up to a maximum number of levels equal to the character's
  (Compassion).  This benefit applies to all beings within (Essence +
  Compassion) yards, regardless of whether they are allies, enemies or
  bystanders.

  By this point, the martial artist has learned to draw down higher power
  into himself, and apply it to his actions on those around him.  Now, he
  extends his awareness of the nature of all beings, and uses it to raise
  himself up.
  
  This Charm gives the character a clear awareness of the ratings for Virtues,
  Willpower and Essence, for each being in her line of sight, up to (Essence x
  Willpower) yards.  Any penalties to observing the location targets due to
  Stealth, invisibility or partial cover are reduced by the character's (Essence
  รท 2), as their true natures shine out.  Immaterial beings are locatable as if
  they were materialized, though only as a nebulous shape embodying these
  traits.  In all cases, the true appearance of such hidden beings remains
  unknown, unless revealed by other means.
  
  Furthermore, on any successful attack, the character may reflexively spend 2
  motes in step 10 to attempt to temporarily reduce one of these traits.
  Bashing damage may be used to reduce any one of the Virtues by 1 dot.  Lethal
  damage may do the same, or reduce the target's mote pool by [Essence] motes.
  Aggravated damage may alternatively reduce temporary Willpower by 1 dot.
  Immaterial targets are also subject to this effect on a successful attack,
  which ignores their immaterial state, though they suffer no physical damage or
  other contact effects unless by some other means.  The targeted traits cannot
  be reduced past 1.  Any dots or motes drained are added to the character's own
  traits, though they cannot surpass the normal limits, and these bonuses fade
  at the end of the scene.
  
  Merely learning this Charm has benefits in itself.  Any practitioner of this
  style may choose an additional non-ranged form weapon when first she learns
  it.  Dragon-Blooded who learn this Charm gain access to Celestial martial
  arts, including the rest of this style.

  In due course a wise man must harness the raw creative energy seen in
  [Hokhmah] to tease out its potential, and working through its possibilities.
  
  With this Charm active, the martial artist sees the consequences of his own
  and others' actions.  Any unexpected attacks against him are no longer
  unexpected.  The penalty from any coordinated attacks against him is reduced
  by his Essence.  The character gains an automatic counterattack against each
  attack on him, though he suffers flurry penalties in counterattacking
  flurries.  When counterattacking, he may target and damage dematerialized
  beings as if they were materialized, and any external penalties due to Stealth
  effects employed by that attacker are reduced by his Essence.
  
  If the character already has [Hokhmah] active, this Charm may be activated
  without paying the Willpower cost.
  
  Only characters who have access to Celestial martial arts can learn this
  Charm.

  Opening herself up to raw, pre-conscious creative insight, the martial
  artist's actions spring from nowhere, from the primal energy of Chaos.  With
  this Charm active, all of the character's attacks for the rest of the scene
  become unexpected.
  
  In addition, any attack which causes damage also has the chance of afflicting
  a temporary Wyld mutation, chosen by the storyteller, as a Shaping effect.
  The character makes a contested roll of ([Essence + Willpower] รท 2) against
  the target.  If the character wins, the target suffers a mutation; if she
  botches, she suffers one herself.  Bashing damage inflicts a pox or
  deficiency, lethal an affliction or debility, and aggravated a blight or
  deformity.
  
  If the target (or the character) has already suffered a mutation due to this
  Charm in the current scene, the new mutation replaces the previous one.  If
  the target uses magic to resist this Shaping effect, the character gains a
  point of Hodge.  The mutation fades at the end of the scene.
  
  [TODO: Not sure what this should do against raksha, since I don't know
  anything about their combat system.]
  
  If the character already has [Binah] active, this Charm may be activated
  without paying the Willpower cost.
  
  Only characters who have access to Celestial martial arts can learn this
  Charm.

  Reaching the pinnacle of her form, the martial artist internalises all
  she has learned, and is able to apply it unconsciously, her faith in higher
  powers rewarded with a direct connection.
  
  After learning this Charm, all Simple Charms in this form become Reflexive,
  and all Charms with the Combo-Basic keyword change to Combo-OK.  Any
  pre-existing Combos involving Combo-Basic Charms from this form may be
  extended to include other Charms, by paying the difference in experience.
  This extension may only be carried out once per Combo.
  
  Also, the character may reflexively spend 1 Willpower at any point in a scene,
  after which all Charms in this form have their Willpower cost reduced by 1, to
  a minimum of 0, and their mote cost reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.
  
  Only characters who have access to Celestial martial arts can learn this
  Charm.
