text: The Lotus Tree Form focuses on increasing the martial artist's fighting prowess by bringing him to a higher understanding of how his base, mortal nature is derived from the underlying nature of Creation, which connects him to higher powers and to everything around him, including those he fights.

The origins of this form are obscure.  Forming a bridge between the Terrestrial and Celestial arts for Dragon-Blooded warriors, it is clearly intended for their use.  Yet it bypasses the path of Pasiap's Humility and, while not explicitly heretical, its philosophical focus on a personal connection to higher powers doesn't sit comfortably with Immaculate teachings.  Some bronze faction Sidereals suspect their Solar-loving adversaries have developed it to undermine the Immaculate faith, while correspondingly some members from other factions see it as yet another bronze mechanism of reward and control.  Those less obsessed with factions worry that it might have come from some other source altogether.  In any case, it has so far been learned by only a few of the more esoterically-inclined Immaculates, and a slightly larger number of Outcaste martial artists.

Ths style weapons of this form are those worn closest to the body: fighting gauntlets and boots, including tiger claws, and certain close-combat enhancement such as razor harnesses.  The style is compatible with light armor.

text: Mastery of the Martial Arts requires discipline, but the path is not found by repressing one's natural impulses, rather by focussing them.  The student acknowledges her passions, and begins to see how to open them up to inspiration from higher powers.

When purchasing this Charm, the character chooses an existing Intimacy, which is at full strength (equal to his Conviction).  Thereafter, they may channel this Intimacy as if it were a Virtue, though only on Martial Arts actions which support that Intimacy.  As with Virtues, each use reduces the number of channels by one, until they are refreshed at the end of the story.  Each time the character channels this Intimacy, it counts as a scene spent reinforcing that Intimacy, if applicable, though this never increases the number of channels available.

If the Intimacy is broken, the character may rebuild it and continue to use this Charm, or spend 2xp to transfer it to another Intimacy.  If the Intimacy is somehow corrupted or otherwise changed, the Charm remains connected to that Intimacy, unless and until it is broken and the character pays experience to transfer it.

text: Higher powers are all very well, but a student of the Martial Arts needs a firm foundation in the physical realm, if she is to apply her blows effectively.

For the cost of two motes, the character may activate this Charm to ignore any single, non-magical effect which would cause knockdown, knockback, or otherwise move her.  If the effect is magical, the cost increases by a number of motes equal to the attacker's Essence.  Against effects from beings whose Essence is greater than the character's own Essence, she must succeed on a Valor roll, or else this Charm fails.

text: One who fights from the heart as much as with his fists understands that he may defeat an enemy by many means.  Sometimes, it is enough to convince one's opponent of the error of his ways, and shame him into stepping down.

This Charm is used in an attempt to end combat.  The character may use it in any action on which he calls on his opponents to stop fighting, provided he is making an honest attempt to bring hostilies to a halt.  The Charm cannot be used if he has attacked or counterattack on that action (though he may defend), or believes that any allies of his will ignore his call for truce.  If anyone attacks him in that action, successfully or not, he gains a bonus of (Temperance) dice to any attacks against them on his next action.  If nobody attacks him, but he goes back on his word and attacks on his next action, such attacks will be at an internal penalty of -(Temperance), due to shame at failing to live up do his own standards of integrity.

This Charm is specifically permitted to be used in a Combo with Charms from other Abilities.  For example, it might be used with a Presence-based Charm to lend weight to the charater's plea.

text: If your enemy does not see that she is in the wrong, then to strike her down is a kindness, for surely she must learn this.

The character supplements his attack with this Charm, sending his opponent flying and redirecting any wounding force into this effort.  On a successful attack, the target takes no damage but must make a check against Knockback.  The attacker still makes a damage roll, ignoring Hardness.  Any unsoaked levels of damage are treated instead as an internal penalty to the Knockback check.  If the target fails the check, the distance they travel is multiplied by the character's
Compassion, and they must check for Stunning using the unsoaked damage value calculated.

The martial artist cannot activate this Charm if he believes that the Knockback will leave the target in greater danger (for example, knocking them towards an ally of the character, or off the edge of a cliff).

text: Experience can be its own reward, if one learns from one's failures; but sometimes warriors and heroes are blessed with greater rewards.  Whether this is pure luck, the meddling of the Maidens, or some twist of the fabric of reality, who can say?  And, really, who would stop to ask?

Activating this Form, the character performs a ritual survey of the world, preparing himself to learn from all that happens: he looks all around himself, then down at his own hands and feet, then within himself, and lastly into the eyes of his opponents.

While this Charm is active, attacks which are made in earnest, but fail, attract the benificence of some higher power to give the martial artist a chance to survive longer and try again.  If an attack fails to hit an opponent at all, the next time the character defends against an attack, he adds (Martial Arts ÷ 2) to his Dodge and Parry DV.  If instead his attack hits, but does no damage due to the opponent's Hardness or Soak, his next defence gains the bonus of (Martial Arts ÷ 2) to his bashing and lethal soak, as well as to his DVs.

If the character makes a flurry of attacks, and only some fail, then each separate failure grants bonuses against one separate subsequent attack.  [TODO: Not sure if these bonuses should go away at the start of the character's next action, i.e., when his DV refreshes.]

Lastly, the first time a character would be reduced to Incapacitated or Dying in that scene, he instead remains on one -4 health level.

text: If his enemies try the patience of the martial artist too greatly, he may be unwilling to teach them lessons, or even allow them into his presence.  With a harsh glance of contempt, the budding master warns off those who offend him.

This Charm evokes feelings of shame and inadequacy in any who would attack or approach the character, or simply look him in the eyes.  Anyone who can perceive the martial artist and has a Dodge MDV less than his (Willpower + Martial Arts) suffers an internal penalty equal to his (Willpower ÷ 2) to any actions which include an attack on or motion toward him.

If the character attacks a given opponent, any penalty imposed by this Charm is immediately removed for that opponent.  Furthermore, an opponent may pay 1wp to overcome this effect for the remainder of the scene.

text: The principle of charity, whereby love and help are given regardless of the recipients merits, has an analog in the world of combat.  Driving her strikes from the center of her own being, regardless of an opponent's actions, she makes it much more difficult for anyone to predict, and hence defend against, her actions.

This Charm supplements a Martial Arts attack, imposing an external penalty on the opponent's Parry and Dodge DV equal to the character's Martial Arts rating.  If the chracter is attempting an unexpected attack, add (Martial Arts) dice to the (Dexterity + Stealth) roll.  If the victim notices the attack, he or she still suffers a DV penalty as before.

text: As the martial artist truly begins to master this form, he begins to sense the bridge between the simple forms of reality and the underlying Essence which forms it.

He becomes able to see the Essence signature of all beings within a range of (Martial Arts + Essence) yards.  This allows him to see immaterial beings, and grants a +2 bonus to any applicable rolls to perceive hidden or invisible beings.  It does not allow him to see through walls or full cover.  It also allows him to strike immaterial beings, albeit at a -2 penalty to accuracy and damage.

From the Essence patterns he observes, the master will understand whether a being is significantly more or less powerful than himself, but will gain no other information.

Dragon-Blooded who learn this Charm gain access to Celestial martial arts, including the rest of this style.  Mortals are not enlightened by learning this Charm, however, and may not progress beyond it in this style.

text: Though the pinnacle of mastery may be some kind of union with a higher reality, those who remain in this one must apply what flashes of understanding they gain to the battles in which they find themselves.

With this Charm active, the martial artist sees the actions and reactions of combat play out clearly in his mind, that awareness flowing effortlessly into his body.  Any unexpected attacks against him are no longer unexpected.  The character gains an automatic counterattack for any successful attack against him.  Such counterattacks are not subject to any penalties due to the attacker being concealed, invisible or immaterial.  This Charm itself does not grant the ability to strike immaterial beings, nor does it remove penalties against concealed foes except when counterattacking.  This Charm does not grant its benefits if the character is Incapacitated, asleep or similarly unable to observe and act.

Only characters who have access to Celestial martial arts can learn this Charm.

text: Opening herself up to raw, pre-conscious insight, the martial artist gains access to the creative power of the energies underlying reality.

This Charm forms raw Essence into one of the character's form weapons, which will have some iconic appearance related to the his personal nature.  This weapon acts as a basic artifact version of the relevant weapon, with no hearthstone settings and with magical material bonuses appropriate to the character's Exalted type (if any).  The character can reflexively change its manifestation between her two form weapons at any time.  If he acutally wields a corresponding form weapon in the same hand(s), that weapon gains +1 to Accuracy, Defense and Damage.  In any case, disarming him becomes impossible.  Two-handed or paired weapons incur a four-mote surcharge.  The weapon is able to strike immaterial creatures, though this Charm does not grant the ability to see such beings.

Only characters who have access to Celestial martial arts can learn this Charm.

After learning this Charm, all Simple Charms in this form become Reflexive, and all Charms with the Combo-Basic keyword change to Combo-OK.  Any pre-existing Combos involving Combo-Basic Charms from this form may be extended to include other Charms, by paying the difference in experience.  This extension may only be carried out once per Combo.

Also, the character may reflexively spend 1 Willpower at any point in a scene, after which all Charms in this form have their mote cost reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.
