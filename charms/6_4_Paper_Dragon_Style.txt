Paper Dragon Style: a DMA based on Bureaucracy.

MA themes to put in:

* Improve damage, DVs, soak, hardness.

* Change speed of own or others' actions.

* Grapple: hold/throw, escape

* Disarm

* Redirecting attacks, Defend Other

* Extra Action

* Counterattack

* Unexpected attack

* Remote attack/defence with extra weapons

* Form-Type, Pinnacle

Bureaucracy themes to affect:

* Bribery, commerce, running projects, paperwork.

* Written attacks; signatures and seals; forms

* Policy: cut away or bend Intimacies and Motivation.

* Loyalty: sap or impose penalties.

* Prepare plans, similar to using plans in manse/artifact building: reduce
  time for later actions and/or add successes.

* General duration reduction.

Ideas:

* Carmine/Vermilion Ribbon Entaglement: "grapple" which slows progress in
  the target project, increasing its duration and/or imposing an external
  (or, internal?) penalty.

* Perfect reproduction of official signature/stamp -- not a forgery, rather an
  excercise of perfect skill.  Allows a specific document to be signed, or
  makes a written Social attack on the organization undodgeable.

* Mantle of Bureaucratic authority -- Minor Usurupation

* Shedding/tearing paper scales: Tear away Intimacies/Policy.  Permanent, or
  temporary as Illusion.  Or, shed something (staff, Intimacies, Magnitude) to
  deflect negative effects (remove penalties).

* Contract-Rending Claw: allow the organisation to back out of a deal without
  penalties, by finding some weak point in the contract; and/or, force them to
  break a deal, possibly suffering the negatives.  (Compare with DB Charm for
  putting nasty clauses in.)  Maybe upgrade to break Geasa, Eclipse-style
  oaths etc.?

* Cutting off a smaller part from the whole; pulling a local office out of the
  larger organisation.

* Record-Correction Maneuver, Decision-Bending Prana

> Discordian Martial Arts (DMAs) apply the principles of Martial Arts --
  focus, specialisation, style -- to other Abilities.  Only those who can
  learn Sidereal Martial Arts can learn them, though they are not as powerful
  as those Arts, being concerned with slightly more mundane endeavors.  In
  general thay have a similar structure to Celestial Martial Arts, usually
  require Essence between 3 and 7, may require some device to be worn or
  wielded in the same vein as form weapons, and tend not to have Charms which
  are of type Simple (Dramatic Action) or of duration longer than a scene,
  including Indefinite [unless the Charm affects some other thing which has a
  duration longer than a scene?]
