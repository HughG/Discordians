  Paper Dragon Style: a DMA based on Bureaucracy.
  
  MA themes to put in:
  
  * Improve damage, DVs, soak, hardness.
  
  * Change speed of own or others' actions.
  
  * Grapple: hold/throw, escape
  
  * Disarm
  
  * Redirecting attacks, Defend Other
  
  * Extra Action
  
  * Counterattack
  
  * Unexpected attack
  
  * Remote attack/defence with extra weapons
  
  * Form-Type, Pinnacle
  
  Bureaucracy themes to affect:
  
  * Bribery, commerce, running projects, paperwork.
  
  * Written attacks; signatures and seals; forms
  
  * Policy: cut away or bend Intimacies and Motivation.
  
  * Loyalty: sap or impose penalties.
  
  * Prepare plans, similar to using plans in manse/artifact building: reduce
    time for later actions and/or add successes.
  
  * General duration reduction.
  
  Ideas:
  
  * DONE Paper Dragon Coils: grapple-style continuing opposed roll to put a
    project on hold.
  
    * Carmine/Vermilion Ribbon Entaglement: "grapple" which slows progress in
      the target project, increasing its duration and/or imposing an external
      (or, internal?) penalty.
  
  * Paper Dragon Claws: allow you to act as if a member of the org, removing
    external penalties from not being a member.
  
  * Monkey? Insert self into hierarchy, including gods & demons.
  
  * Tape-Evading X Maneuver: removes a single Bureaucractic obstacle.
  
  * Double-Dealing X: allow org to perform multiple projects simultaneously at
    full efficiency, as long a character is involved in one; doesn't remove need
    for physical resources, labor etc.
  
  * X: UMI to make org good at something opposed to its policies?
  
  * Perfect reproduction of official signature/stamp -- not a forgery, rather an
    excercise of perfect skill.  Allows a specific document to be signed, or
    makes a written Social attack on the organization undodgeable.
  
  * Mantle of Bureaucratic authority -- Minor Usurupation
  
  * Shedding/tearing paper scales: Tear away Intimacies/Policy.  Permanent, or
    temporary as Illusion.  Or, shed something (staff, Intimacies, Magnitude) to
    deflect negative effects (remove penalties).
  
  * DONE Contract-Rending Claw: allow the organisation to back out of a deal
    without penalties, by finding some weak point in the contract; and/or, force
    them to break a deal, possibly suffering the negatives.  (Compare with DB
    Charm for putting nasty clauses in.) Maybe upgrade to break Geasa,
    Eclipse-style oaths etc.?
  
  * Cutting off a smaller part from the whole; pulling a local office out of the
    larger organisation.
  
  * Record-Correction Maneuver, Decision-Bending Prana
  
  * Affecting Backgrounds such as Backing, Connections, etc.
  
  ****
  Discordian Martial Arts (DMAs) apply the principles of Martial Arts --
  focus, specialisation, style -- to other Abilities.  Practitioners must have
  a rating of at least 3 in Martial Arts, as well as meeting the minimums for
  each Charm.  Only those who can learn Sidereal Martial Arts can learn them,
  though they are not as powerful as those Arts, being concerned with slightly
  more mundane endeavors.  In general thay have a similar structure to
  Celestial Martial Arts, usually require Essence between 3 and 7, may require
  some device to be worn or wielded in the same vein as form weapons, and tend
  not to have Charms which are of type Simple (Dramatic Action) or of duration
  longer than a scene, including Indefinite [unless the Charm affects some
  other thing which has a duration longer than a scene?].

  [TODO: Not sure this Charm seems powerful enough.  Perhaps I should just
  introduce the notion of a "Social/Bureucratic Clinch" as a new standard
  action, and this Charm should enhance it, adding successes, penalties and/or
  dragging out the duration?  If so, I guess groups would always be free to
  leave -- so not physically clinched -- but would lose face (i.e., Loyalty) if
  they did so.]
  
  The Erisian uses this Charm to supplement a Bureacracy action in which he
  commands or persuades one organisation to oppose another, attempting to turn
  the interaction into a bureaucratic clinch.  The opposition may be a direct
  engagement such as contract negotiation or competition in some market, or an
  indirect contest for something else such as territory, trade rights and so on.
  
  The attacking organisation rolls ([Charisma, Manipulation or Intelligence] +
  Bureaucracy), adding (Essence) successes, and compares it to the target's MDV,
  factoring in Magnitude bonuses unless the two leaders act face-to-face in a
  "duel".  Success means that the target organisation can do nothing effective
  in that action, and the attacking organisation can do one of the following
  things.  It can do nothing else, without a flurry.
  
  Break Hold: The attacking group suddenly disengages, leaving its opponents in
  confused disarray.  The target group must take an action to marshal its
  efforts, so can do nothing else without a flurry, and is at a -1 MDV penalty
  for that time.
  
  Crush: The leader of the target organisation loses a number of Loyalty points
  equal to half the extra successes on the attack roll, rounded up.
  
  [TODO: Maybe Crush should impose (cumulative) internal penalties, which
  gradually reduce over time?]
  
  Hold: The attacking organisation simply keeps the target body busy, preventing
  it from carrying out any other activities. 
  
  On subsequent actions, the two sides must make an opposed roll of ([Charisma,
  Manipulation or Intelligence] + Bureaucracy), though the character's side
  gains no bonus successes from this Charm, unless it is reactivated.  The
  winner gainst control of the clinch and may take one of the three actions
  above.  The losing side cannot apply its MDV against attacks without a stunt,
  but can use reflexive Charms or actions.  Individual members of each side may
  take other actions as individuals, as long as enough remain committed to the
  interaction to keep the group at the same level of Magnitude.  If the leader
  of either group takes separate actions without a flurry, that group
  automatically loses the clinsh on that action.  If both leaders take other
  actions, the clinch ends with no further effects.
  
  At Essence 4 the interval for the opposed rolls increases to a week, and at
  Essence 5 to a month.

  This Charm is used as part of a social attack against a group, tearing away at
  its integrity by confusing the members as to where their loyalties should lie.
  The character frames his attack it as best he can in terms of the group's
  standards and processes, and attempts to subtly phrase his intent to allow it
  to be misinterpreted as being in line with the group's Policy. This imposes an
  external penalty of -(Essence รท 2) on the leader's Parry MDV. If the attack
  succeeds, the leader loses (Bureaucracy) Loyalty points even if he accedes to
  the request or, if he resists, a further (Bureaucracy รท 2) points beyond the
  one he spends to resist.

  By following and filling out the expected forms, one can persuade a group to
  accept what an individual would not. This Charm allows the character to
  understand the signs and procedures of a target group, causing it to regard
  him as having the same authority as any normal member of the group. This
  removes any penalties to actions due to not being a member, and may reduce the
  difficulty of some actions by up to (Bureaucracy) or make valid some actions
  which would otherwise be impossible, at the Storyteller's discretion. The
  character is treated as having a Backing rating of (Bureaucracy รท 2) in the
  organization. The character does not automatically know the details of the
  organisation's functioning but can normally find them out with little effort,
  including where specific information, resources and individuals can be found.
  Keys, passwords and the like may require further effort to obtain.
  
  The effect is not an Illusion, so the members will still know that he is not
  in fact one of them, absent any other disguise etc.  Rather, he is treated as
  a close trading partner, visiting academic, allied akuma or the like.  If he
  does something which is obviously suspicious or counter to the group's
  interests, he may be come subject to penalties or active opposition.
  
  In the case of groups which overlap, or a group which harbors some inner
  circle or fifth column, the character can activate this Charm multiple times
  to gain access to several groups at once, provided he aware of their
  existence.

  TODO
  
  This Charm provides a magical flurry of up to (Essence) Bureaucracy actions,
  either to the character or to a group for which the character acts.  If
  relevant, the MDV or DV penalty for the flurry is the highest penalty of any
  one action.  If a group makes the flurry, the character need not lead it but
  must take or aid in at least one of the actions.
  
  If two or more of the actions constitute the beginning of long-term projects
  (that is, the first roll of a series of extended rolls), the character can
  commit both the motes and a point of Willpower to these efforts. Doing so
  brings a synergy which allows the group to undertake more concurrent work than
  it normally could, and benefit from reduced MDV and DV penalties in doing so.
  The groups efforts may still be hampered due to lack of Resources, for
  example, but not lack of staff (that is, Magnitude). This use of the Charm
  ends if the character release the motes, or ceases to be involved in at least
  one of the projects, or once all the projects end. At Essence 4, the character
  can apply any number of these extra actions to the same project, allowing
  multiple rolls at each interval, with the aim of reducing the project's
  duration.

  This Charm allows the character to instantly free a target organisation from a
  contract or other promise without any penalties. If the contract is reinforced
  by Charms or Sorcery, for example the Dragon-Blooded Charm known as Drowning
  in Negotiation Style or the spirit Charm called Geas, then the character must
  succeed on a roll of ([Manipulation or Intelligence] + Bureacracy) at a
  difficulty equal to the Essence of the source of the effect. Failure indicates
  that the binding stands, whereas a botch terminates it and causes any
  penalties to apply at maximum effect.
  
  At Essence 4+, this Charm can be activated in combat time, and can be applied
  to individuals, and to magic from any source, including Eclipse Caste and Fair
  Folk oaths.  Unless the character's Essence exceeds that of the source of the
  binding, these greater magics are only lifted for a single scene.
  
  With Bureaucracy 5 and Essence 5, the character can even excuse beings from
  all-encompassing obedience which is inherent to their nature, for example
  excusing gods from having to expend Willpower to ignore orders from their
  superiors, freeing summoned Elementals from their bindings, or having demons
  count as "strangers" in Malfeas.  Such exceptions only ever last for a single
  scene.

  the authority of a member; his rating in Backing, Command, Cult, Henchmen,
  Infamy, Retainers, Spies. While active, he cannot have his authority in

  Too often, those who serve a larger cause get caught up in that service
  and give it more credence than they give themselves; which is something to be
  taken advantage of. This Charm causes an organistion to deny the truth (and
  "adjust" any records) of a particular fact, or introduce a new "fact" into
  their archives and common understanding. It must be activated in the presence
  of a member of the organisation, or in one of its offices, permanent or
  temporary.
  
  The target organisation can have a Magnitude of no more than the character's
  (Essence + Bureaucracy). The datum added or removed must be about something
  external to the organisation so, for example, an Erisian cannot make himself
  the new leader of the Immaculate Order.
  
  The character rolls ([Manpiulation or Intelligence] + Bureaucracy) and adds
  his permanent Essence in successes. If this exceeds the MDV of the group's
  leader (who need not be physically present) then the unnatural mental
  influence of the Compulsion takes hold. It can be resisted at a cost of one
  Loyalty point per scene, and the effect lifts once a total of three points has
  been spent.  By that point decisions may have been made and records updated,
  depending on the efficiency of the organization.
  
  Any member of the group who was in the process of dealing with that fact (if
  it disappeared) or a closely related subject (if it just appeared) may resist
  the effect as unnatural mental influence, at a similar cost of one Willpower
  per scene, with the effect lifting (for them) once they have spend a
  cumulative total of three Willpower. If they resist, they will be certain of
  the original truth of the matter, even though many of their colleagues may be
  baffled by their strange opinion. For those who cannot or fail to resist, they
  immediately come to believe the new truth. Regardless of whether the leader or
  any number of members spend Loyalty or Willpower to resist, the character
  gains at most one point of Hodge per scene.
  
  Note that there is nothing preventing the organisation from subsequently
  correcting its observations and updating its records.  However, in the short
  term, this Charm can be remarkably useful for such tasks as escaping from the
  attentions of the Wyld Hunt.  Also, for information which is truly hard to
  discover, the organisation may never be able to re-learn the truth.

  A word in the right butterfly-like ear can have unexpected effects far
  away. This Charm assists an attempt by the character to manipulate a single
  in-process decision within an organisation. Its target is any single member of
  the organisation, no matter how lowly: the magic of the Charm will work its
  way toward the real decision-maker (who may or may not be the one officially
  in that role, and may or may not be the group's leader).
  
  The character rolls ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Bureaucracy) and, if the
  total exceeds the target's MDV, an unnatural mental influence of Compulsion
  causes the decision to go the way the character desires.  Either the decision
  maker or the group's leader may overrule the decision, at the time or later,
  by spending three points of Loyalty, which must be spent all at once.
  
  This Charm is only effective upon decisions which the organisation was already
  intending to make, and has not yet settled. It cannot force a group to decide
  to do something which had never crossed its collective mind. The character may
  take other actions to set up a situation which requires a decision, of course.
