FONTLOG for Libertinage Basic SC
-------------------
This file provides detailed information on the Libertinage font software.
This information should be distributed along with the Libertinage fonts
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information
--------------------------
Libertinate Basic SC is a copy of Libertinage, with lowercase letters in
the Basic Latin range replced with small capitals generated by FontForge.
It was created by Hugh Greene for use with software which cannot
automatically find or create small caps variants (specifically, Apache FOP
1.0).

Libertinage is a remix of Linux Libertine and was designed in August 2008.
For more detailed information: http://ospublish.constantvzw.org

We built Libertinage by copying and pasting parts of Linux Libertine glyphs. There are 26 variations, one for each latin letter in the alphabet.
This version is the 'Full' version, containing all modifications.

The original Libertinage included single letter versions named Libertinage-a,
Libertinage-b, Libertinage-c... depending on the letter that was
changed, plus a Libertinage.ttf gathering all the modified glyphs.
Libertinage Basic includes only a modified version of this last file.

Libertinage currently provides the following Unicode coverage:
Basic Latin: 95/95 
Latin-1 Supplement: 96/96 

Libertinage Basic provides small capitals only in the Basic Latin range.
