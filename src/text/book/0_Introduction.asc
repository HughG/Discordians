== Introduction

[verse, Nietzsche]
``I tell you, one must still have chaos in one
to give birth to a dancing star!''

[verse, Bruce]
``There’s nothing Nietzsche couldn’t teach ya
’bout the raising of the wrist.''

You hold in your hands one of the Great Books of ancient mythic
para-history fnord. This document describes the background, powers and
context of the Exalted of Eris, goddess of discord. They have appeared
in Creation and other realms in the most recent centuries of the Time of
Tumult, and the few existing powers who have pieced together some
evidence about them can’t quite work out what they’re up to. Perhaps you
can ...

=== How to Use This Book

*The Manual of Exalted Power--Discordians* is an extension of White Wolf’s
Exalted game, providing rules and background information to run stories
featuring the mysterious Chosen of Eris, be they as player characters or
antagonists. This is not a complete game by itself: you’ll need to consult the
Exalted core book to play. The book’s contents are as follows:

[role="noindent"]
*<<Chapter_1_Eris>>*

This chapter describes how the ``lucky few'' are Chosen by Eris to do her
work, and how the process of their Exaltation functions. It reveals
details--some of which may even be correct--about some of their power
groups in various realms of existence. It also sheds some light on the
origins and motivations of Eris Herself.

[role="noindent"]
*<<Chapter_2_Character_Creation>>*

This chapter contains the rules for generating a Discordian character.

[role="noindent"]
*<<Chapter_3_Traits>>*

This section explains how standard Exalted traits apply to Erisian
Exalts, and details their unique features.

[role="noindent"]
*<<Chapter_4_Charms>>*

Here you can read the juicy details of the mystical Charms with which
the Discordians find themselves equipped.

[role="noindent"]
*<<Chapter_5_Numerology>>*

This chapter details the Discordians’ ability to bend the rules of
reality around them, in small but effective ways, by sheer force of
will.  It also includes some comments on Sorcery.

[role="noindent"]
*<<Chapter_6_Storytelling>>*

As ever, this chapter gives suggestions on how a Storyteller can run a
Discordian story, or fit them into a tale featuring or focussing on some
of the other types of Exalted.

[role="noindent"]
*<<Chapter_7_Characters>>*

Although most of the Children of Eris seem to be relative newcomers to
Creation, they have already spread their tendrils wide. Discordians both
wizened and green are introduced here, as examples or ready-made
antagonists.

[role="noindent"]
*<<Chapter_8_Panoply>>*

Lastly, no foray into the worlds of the Exalted would be complete
without some strange and wonderful toys. Find here some crafted for and
by the Children.

=== Suggested Resources

==== Fiction

_Principia Discordia_, Malacylpse the Younger

The book that started it all, containing the ever-evolving One True
Source of Discordianism.

_The Illuminatus! Trilogy_, Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson

This epic, meandering and confusing tale of counter-conspiracies within
conspiracies is ultimately driven by a deep-cover Discordian, and Eris
plays a brief but large (50-foot tall) part.

_Iron Council_, China Miéville

The lyrical prose of this book leads the reader on ways which make the
transition into the Wyld (in the form of the ``cacotopic stain'') less
jarring than it might normally seem. It also ends with an example of how
a person can exert magical control over the world, after having
understood how to submit themselves to its inherent patterns.

_The Telling_, Ursula K. Le Guin

A society which takes mystery as part of everyday life, and so is not confused
by it.  The two who are one understand the five.  Everyone has their own
offshoots of the tale of the world, and so the truth has many leaves.  As one
branch ends, so its telling begins.

==== Comics

_The Invisibles_, Grant Morrison

This series touches on many Discordian themes in a more mystical (and
disturbing) way than _Illuminatus_, and shows that mastering
transcendent power requires coming to a new understanding of oneself. It
is also the inspiration for the idea of Divisional Realignment, and
hence the separation between Divisions and Parametadivisions.

_V for Vendetta_, Alan Moore

While not quite Exalted, V is clearly a heroic mortal who’s a likely
candidate for being sprinkled with fairy dust. Also, he disrupts Fate in
his own way.

==== Movies

_Southland Tales_, Richard Kelly

This is what Discordians might get up to in an Exalted Modern setting:
confusing people and pushing them into a number of overlapping conspiracies
and plots, which don't quite make sense but somehow manage to achieve a
mixture of destruction and enlightenment, possibly as much by luck as by
design.

==== Poetry

_Rumi_

The sufi mystic talks of finding a higher power, and a higher self, in
everyday moments. I’ve no idea if it’s true but it’s full of lovely
confusion. _Whoever Brought Me Here Will Have To Take Me Home_, a
translation by Coleman Barks, is a good taster.
