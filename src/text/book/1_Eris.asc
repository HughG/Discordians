[[Chapter_1_Eris]]
== Eris Discordia

=== Background

[verse]
``I can explain it to you,
but I can’t understand it for you.''

There are several theories about where the Discordian Exalted--the Children of
Eris--have come from, and what they are up to. They do not claim to be hero,
villain, or victim; guardian, guide or genius; or not consistently,
leastways. Perhaps they are heralds but, if so, their message has yet to be
understood. They re-cast themselves on a whim, and perhaps that is the
message. Some, all or none of the following may be true, but one thing is
certain: they’re causing trouble out there somewhere.

=== Origins

==== Discordians Arise

Rumors have been circulating, among those circles which don’t officially
exist, that there is some new type of Exalt appearing, in Creation and
elsewhere. So far recognition of them as a new kind of power has been confined
to elder Sidereals and Lunars, plus certain obscure gods, but these things
always leak. Lytek has said nothing about any discrepancies among the
Exaltations in his care, but he may just be keeping quiet about it, given the
awkwardness already surrounding the ones which have stopped passing through
his office. Nobody can be quite sure Autochthon didn’t do some favors for some
other parties before disappearing, either. And, the more is uncovered about
them, the more researchers wonder how long they’ve really been around.

There is no obvious pattern to the works and beings which have been observed,
and individually they might be explained away, but there are just slightly too
many of them for comfort. Heroes too powerful to be mortals, even enlightened
ones, who carry out some dramatic rescue and then disappear without trace in
legend or Loom. Traveling preachers who somehow manage to read clear heresy
into the Immaculate texts, upsetting the control of Realm satrapies. Creatures
seen in the Deep Wyld which take on and shrug off the madness of its many
forms at will, showing neither moonsilver tattoos nor fear of iron. Unexpected
changes in the Loom, with little of the damage usually caused by powerful
Essence use and without the holes in the pattern which follow those outside
Fate. A dark-armored figure seen emerging from remote shadowlands, playing
strange tunes on a bone flute and leading crowds of ghosts, which gradually
dissolve and disappear. Strange artifacts found at cave mouths on the lower
slopes of Meru, by those put there to guard it, carrying a charge of Essence
but with no discernible function. The only connecting thread seems to be that
these events subtly stir things in ways which have greater and wider
implications than expected; that, and a name: Eris Discordia.

[[Discordian_Exaltation,Discordian Exaltation]]
==== The Discordian Exaltation

[verse]
``First I must sprinkle you
with Fairy Dust.''

The mechanics of the Discordian Exaltations are unknown, beyond the motic
patterns common to all such shards of power. Eris has not come forth to
explain where she got them or how many they are and, if they _have_ passed
through Lytek’s office, it’s only been to raid his drawers for spare memories
of other Exalts. Few enough have been identified by scholars (or other
Discordians) while embodied that nobody has a clear idea of the human traits
they are drawn to.

From the point of view of her ``lucky'' Chosen, however, the experience of
Exaltation is confusing but unmistakable. It arrives at times of
crisis--seldom the life-or-death crunch point of many Exaltations, rather when
a mortal finds radical insight into the world or herself, be it on a physical,
political, mystical or other level. She somehow realizes that the rules that
she has taken for granted are not right, or are not the only kind of right,
and that order and chaos are equally a matter of interpretation.

The orthodox beliefs of Creation say that gods, spirits and the Dragon-Blooded
are there to make things work, or else they would fall apart and return to the
Wyld. But one could just as easily say that Creation fell together--clearly,
the Fair Folk are still drawn to it; or perhaps samsara made it
inevitable--and that the Scarlet Empress’ Realm has stifled the world, and
stopped the more far-flung parts from recovering faster, insofar as they must
devote energies to staying independent. The newly Exalted Erisian sees that
being unbound need not mean falling apart. A man on the Blessed Isle might
notice a carving in a dark corner of a temple roof where a craftsman has
clearly departed from both doctrine and blueprints to include some unorthodox
tableau ... and unavoidably recognize that, despite its heresy, it warms the
heart and in its own way promotes respect for the gods. A woman in Nexus might
see a slave walk free, when an aging master simply forgets that he owns that
slave ...  and then realize that the same thing could have happened, if it had
been the slave who forgot. A barbarian lost in a storm in the North might be
set upon by some beautifully beastly raksha from the skies and carried away in
its claws ... only to have it deposit him safely within walking distance of
Whitewall.

At such a moment, the world seems to stop, and some manifestation of Eris
appears to the character. It may be a rainbow-haired woman, a shower of
glittering motes, a disembodied voice, or simply a warm and incredibly fuzzy
feeling. Whatever it is, the deep meaning of the Discordian Exaltation is
communicated: while the character may become a champion for her own particular
new insight, the core of the matter is that she embeds in herself an
understanding of change, and of the fact that every way of seeing the world
makes sense in its own way.

Thereafter, the experience and state of Erisian Exaltation is in one aspect
fundamentally different from that of all other Exalted, in that the uplifted
mortal does not know where she stands. The Terrestrials and the original, true
Celestials, generally know what they have become and what roles they might
expect to play, when destiny brings an Exaltation to them. Autochthon’s chosen
know what they are on a more fundamental level, coming to life with an
immediate knowledge of their place. Even the twisted agents of the slain or
subjugated Primordials are somewhat aware of the choice they are being given,
and who they are to serve, and they at least _think_ they know how it will
change them. But after that moment of the world holding its breath, Eris
leaves her Children to their own devices, without map or mission. So, what
will _your_ character do next?

==== Eris Herself

Discordians generally know even less about Eris than they do about
themselves, and if they say otherwise, they’re probably lying. The
Chosen are given a brief burst of insight into her nature at the moment
of their Exaltation, but ask them afterwards and you will find them they
inspired but unclear, convinced but inconsistent. They have some idea of
how to serve her cause in their own way, but they don’t exactly know who
or what she is. The Storyteller, of course, will need to know the truth,
which follows; however, it should be taken as ...{nbsp}loose canon.

===== The True Story of Eris

Eris is, in fact, a god known to the Bureaux of Yu-Shan as Nagula, the
Goddess of The Line Between Order and Chaos. Her purview is the notion
and fact of the boundary between Creation and the Wyld. It is an
ever-shifting and necessary thing, at least until Creation falls to the
Wyld, or grows once again to tame it all. It definitely exists but can
never be found precisely. Other gods are thankful for her existence but
often afraid even to talk to her, as her conversation always seems to be
on the brink of nonsense. The Sidereals are wary of her also: standing
so close to the edge of Fate as she does, her movements are extremely
difficult to track or predict.

This combination of thankless task, mind-bending concepts and semi-pariah
status has gradually been disconnecting her from sympathy with either Creation
or the Wyld. Some in heaven also irrationally hold her partly to blame for the
Fair Folk invasion, although it was never her role to defend the edge of
Creation, only to tend to it. And then she stumbled on a small cache of unused
Exaltations, encased in an interleaving of twisted Wyld pockets--perhaps as
some backup strategy of Autochthon’s--and was inspired. She found a way to
bind them to her, and has been sending each out with a different notion of
what she really wants. Her hope is that they’ll show the rest of Creation what
it would really mean for the boundaries of reality to shift. She doesn’t
really have a plan, beyond avoiding detection and enjoying the show.  But her
grip on both these Exaltations and her own sanity is far from firm ...

.First Age Erisians
****
Why haven't you head of these Discordians before?  Have the Sidereals heard of
them?  What have they been doing all this time?  Come to that, why aren't they
in the legends of the First Age?  Well, ...

* There weren't any.  Only in the Time of Tumult, as the boundaries of
Creation and all its neighboring realities are beyond fraying, has enough
inherent Chaos arisen to allow these Exalts to exist.

* They appear in a few tales from the First Age, but the lens of legend leaves
them largely indistinguishable from Sidereals, Lunars, or whatever
Parametadivision they had adopted.

* Ironically, the increasingly insane Solar Exalted, frustrated at failing to
ever understand them fully, hunted them down as "anathema" and purged them
from all records, including their own.

* As the Primordial War finally broke out, the known score of Discordians in
fact erased themselves from Creation.  They used a powerful Discordian
artifact to boost a combined activation of all their Recumbent Destinies,
leaving behind no memories of them, only an indestructible piece of parchment
bearing the sentence, "Our work here is done."  But as each new realm of
reality formed--Autochthonia, the Underworld, Malfeas--more Discordians arose
there, and have been working in secrecy.

* There were a few, but the records of them are largely misinterpreted as the
results of "bleeding edge" Twilight-caste breeding experiments or something
similar.  How and why their numbers have grown since then is a
mystery--indeed, nobody knows how many there are.

* There are some surviving records of them, but almost none have been found
since the Usurpation.  There are some surviving Discordians, too, with great
and mystifying powers.

****

===== The True Story of Eris

That’s the story hinted at by a certain twisted Sidereal Elder, who has
a grudge against poor, half-mad Nagula, and wants to make trouble for
her. But occasional audits have found nothing, so nobody really believes
it.

In reality, Eris is the one being who knows her true identity ... or
rather, his, for Eris is a pseudonym of Xaos, God of Things Not Yet
Discovered. Behind the screen in his office in the Forbidding Manse of
Ivy, he hides not only his Wyld-dissolved form but the fact that he can
now reach out and operate in many places at once, a power that ought to
lie far above his station. He knows that he must find a way to
communicate the true name and nature of the Wyld to the inhabitants of
Creation, or they will be undone by it. Since speaking the name directly
failed too many times, he pored over his lists of unique secrets for
some other way and, ironically just as the aforementioned Sidereal
claims, found a cache of unused Exaltations in the Wyld.

He has now begun to set these Exaltations loose in all the realms he can
reach, inspiring their recipients to find a way to communicate the
genuine experience of the terrible freedom of the raksha, in a way that
each kind of being can understand viscerally, so they know what they
must do. With a follow-up to the Balorian Crusade only a story or two
away, and the Abyssals and Infernals chipping away at the stability of
Creation, he knows there is little time. And all the while, he must try
desperately to prevent anyone learning of his involvement; for as soon
as they do, he will forget his mission himself, and lose power over the
Exalted he has sown among the worlds.

===== The True Story of Eris

That’s a summary of the dossier planted in the Bureau of Secrets, in a
location which leaves it Fated to be the last file read in the Age of
Sorrows. But the dossier is a fake. Left intentionally undiscovered, its
existence is on the periphery of Xaos’ awareness, such that he
unknowingly drops hints about it from time to time; and known,
therefore, to slightly more than one person, it has entirely escaped the
notice of Nara-O.

Eris is, in fact, one of the Incarnae. At least, one who was, is, and/or
will be a sister to the Maidens. Those who come close to understanding
the current five know that they can be replaced, over the course of the
thing the Creation-bound know as time. Even ignoring the Convention on
Forbidden Gods, most of the Bureau of Destiny know about the Little
Sister, and some can read the strange portents in the sky, which hint
ever more strongly that a New Alignment is coming. Constellations drift
and blur by minute, significant amounts, but the broken Mask makes the
signs impossible to read clearly.

Nobody really knows, or will admit to knowing, what the coming of a new
Maiden would look like. It might well begin with unexplained twists in
the Loom, strange new fragments of concepts arising, and, by some
counts, perhaps as many as twenty Exalted witnessed in various places,
whose Exaltations cannot be accounted for. And in the Time of Tumult,
with the world around the stagnant Scarlet Empire flowing wildly, what
new reality-defining concept could be more fitting than the balance
between life and death, chaos and order, security and freedom? Nobody
can prove this for sure, not even Jupiter to herself, but some know it
in their bones.

===== The True Story of Eris

No, these are ridiculous rumors and hearsay. The Convention on Oversight
has dealt with these reports, and there is nothing to them. There is no
``Eris'', that’s all you need to know. (Any suggestions that some of the
Five-Score Fellowship have unlocked powers never seen before, and gone
further astray than any ronin to date, are ... erased.)

.The Time of the Primordials
****

For the Dragon-Blooded, the Primordials are a left-over of the past, fading in
power along with many other heretical terrors.  For the Celestial Exalted,
too, they are a defeated enemy, even if they do occasionally need to be
reminded to stay that way.  But few seem to consider how that millennium-or-so
of captivity appears from their point of view.  The brief lives of mortals
fade into a blur for long-lived Exalted; how, then, must those years seem to
the Primordials?  If the founding of Creation was indeed a party to them,
perhaps their current confinement within Malfeas is equivalent to waking up
the next morning, hung over in a jail cell somewhere.  In that case, the
whimsical Eris might distract them from their revenge by dangling some other
golden carrot in front of their bleary eyes and, if only someone could find a
stable and self-sustaining configuration for Creation, they could fade forever
into the group nightmares of mortal kind ...

****

===== The True Story of Eris

Ah, but they are blessed who, in what they believe to be the privacy of their
own minds, fear the activities of Oversight in this matter; for their fears
are small things, in comparison. The real story (which happens to be Eris’
favorite) is far beyond what the minds and souls of most could bear.

Some of the more scholarly inhabitants of Yu-Shan know a simple story, old
even to them, called ``The Doctrine of the Original Snub''. It tells that Eris
was a god, excluded from a party planned by the other gods, so she crept in
and planted a golden apple inscribed ``To the most beautiful'', and left them
to fight over it. Yet there is no record of such a god, nor such an event, so
most treat it as a charming diversion, perhaps a coded version of some ancient
political incident, interesting only for the fact that similar stories recur
among most of the peoples of Creation.  Interestingly, in southern parts of
the East, the "golden apple" is replaced with an orange, which may have
something to do with why Erisians treat that color as elemental.

However, if one were to read ``gods'' as Primordials, the party as the
founding of Creation, and the apple as the Games of Divinity, then all the
strife since would make a bit more sense--or at least, one would know who to
blame. And this is the truth: Eris Discordia is in fact another Primordial,
one who avoided involvement in the War and (as far as any extant records tell)
most of Creation’s history. Her own repeated rejection by her brothers and
sisters, who sought to exile Chaos from their stronghold against the Wyld,
gave rise to a good deal of fellow-feeling with the Great Maker. Whether she
persuaded him to provide her with her own helping of Exaltations or simply
read his blueprints over his shoulder is unknown, as is quite how many she
has. He was not the only one to hide in the Limbo of Elsewhere, though it’s
not clear whether she abandoned her interest in Creation before or after his
departure, or whether she’s been lurking on the fringes all this time. It may
be that his impending demise and possible return have stirred her to some
extent; doubtless she has her own motives and timetables as well.

Among those who have dared to contemplate this line of thought, some believe
that she wishes the dissolution of Creation, not to Oblivion but as a return
to the pure Chaos of the Wyld. On the other hand, some say that it was Eris
who first planted the idea of forming a stable Creation, as she found complete
Chaos boring. If anyone can do anything they like, nobody really needs to come
into conflict, and where’s the fun in that? Among those who have been in the
Wyld long enough to have more than two hands, it is acknowledged that,
whatever she might want today, she’s likely to change her mind tomorrow, so
one shouldn’t really take any of these theories stories too seriously. But
almost everyone who has heard these theories treats them as thoroughly
academic; after all, everyone knows that all the Primordials are dead,
departed or imprisoned. Imprisoned, yes: all 23 of them; and Eris has nothing
to do with _that_, obviously.

===== Other Stories of Eris

Other rumors about Lady Chaos may or may not include the following.

* Perhaps it was _she_ who suggested to the more well-known Celestial
Maidens that some Exalted of their own would save them spending quite as
much time worrying about the Loom (while secretly hoping they’d end up
meddling as much as other mortals).

* She is said to have both helped the Wyld invasion of Creation when it
seemed in danger of overrunning the Wyld (complete Order being as boring
as complete Chaos), and to have sent her agents to fight off the Wyld
invasion, when it looked like Creation might be destroyed.

* The Discordians may be the Chosen of the Wyld itself, in the form of a
new ishvara, if some great unshaped has found a tale to weave some
Exaltations into the act of passage through the Gateway of Sundraprisha,
hoping to surpass the destruction of the Balorian Crusade and unmake
Creation in a more subtle way.

* She could be some other Forbidden or neglected power: the goddess of
the Yozi’s binding, or some transgressive sub-soul of Cecelyne which
wrestles with balancing what is permitted and what is not.

* Maybe she is the goddess of the Reclamation, who would become the
latest of the Forbidden, if only her existence were known. After all,
she and her Chosen display Malfeas’ arrogance in placing themselves at
the center of things, without caring whether others agree; Cecelyne’s
fascination with borders and rules, with as much will to free others
from them as to make them conform; an understanding of proper order that
mirrors She Who Lives In Her Name, without believing that it is fixed,
or even feasible; Adorjan’s mad freedom of will, without destructive
cruelty; the Ebon Dragon’s blithe willingness to lie, without it being a
compulsion.

* Maybe Sidereal theories about advanced ronin are almost right, except
that these Exalted are in fact _Lunars_, who have merged with the Wyld
without falling completely into chimerism. Eris, then, is one of the
craziest faces yet shown by Luna.

* She may have something to do with the fact that, during the most recent
Calibration, the Changing Moon Lunar who ventured to the mountain-top sanctum
of Sessen Douji (see <<RoGD1>>, p. 60) found it entirely filled with lotus
flowers, but empty of the god himself.

.Empty Drawers
****

If the Discordians are Celestial-level Exalted, why aren't their exaltations
showing up in Lytek's office?  Here are some possibilities ...

* They are, but he's hiding them.

* They are, but for some strange reason nobody is able to notice them.  The
Unconquered Sun could, of course, but he hasn't deigned to drop by for
millenia.

* Eris has arranged for there to be a god whose purview is Discordian
Exaltations specifically, and houses said god in luxurious comfort, far away
from prying eyes.  Thus, the exaltations never head for Lytek's office.

* Despite their level of power, Erisian Exaltations don't actually last beyond
their bearers' lifetimes, as with Dragon-Blooded and Alchemical Exalts.  Out
of Chaos they are born, and unto Chaos they return.

* They would show up, but the last time any were free for any length of time
was before he took office, or at least before the last time he tidied.  In
this Time of Tumult, these exaltations have no trouble finding the next mortal
faced with a shocking realization, so they never make it as far as his
bureau.

* All Erisian Exaltations currently in existence are actually held by First
Age Discordians, who have been out in the Wyld, or have used advanced Charms
to bury their existence deep within unwitting mortals.  Your character is one
of the first new Erisians for years.

****

===== The Last True Story

All the foregoing stories make the classic assumption of any tale: that there
are beings and agents responsible for things that happen. One thought which
has occurred to nobody (except perhaps some Erisians) is that mortals may be
Exalting all by themselves. After all, Discordian Exalted are appearing in
every realm where mortals tread--even Autochthonia. If this were true, the
established powers would likely hope for some explanation along the lines of
the Salinan Working, and then look to pin down the responsible (or rather,
irresponsible) sorceror and make him or her revoke it. However, it’s just
possible it’s begun to happen spontaneously, under no-one’s control. The
original Exaltations were activated by the Incarnae channeling their greatness
into Autochthon’s vessels, but they also relied on the inherent potential for
greatness within mortals. After millennia of being lifted up and beaten down,
and the vital need for heroes as the Age of Sorrows draws closer to its end,
the essence of Exaltation may have rubbed off on some of the souls which have
been bound to them over the ages, allowing that greatness to channel itself.

=== Aims

Frankly, if it wasn’t for the fact that Eris has been largely forgotten,
the list of rumors _not_ involving her would be shorter than the list of
things she’s supposedly poked her Celestial Spanner into. Regardless of
her origin and nature, the real questions are: why is she getting
involved in things now, and what does she want? The only real way to answer
this is by inference from the actions of her Chosen.

Eris chooses those who gain insight into the balance between the forces of
Order and Chaos, which must needs shift to allow every individual’s viewpoint
to express itself. She shows them the (probably) absolute truth of this in a
moment of revelation, at the point of their Exaltation, but it’s up to each of
them to work out what to do with that in their own changed lives. (You never
can predict when she might decide to intercede for or otherwise prod her
Chosen, though.)

The goal of these Exalted, then, is to maintain the creative tension between
these two extremes. Manifestations of order include great mysteries such as
Creation, Yu-Shan, the body of Autochthon, the binding of the Yozi and so on,
but also mundane tyrannies, hierarchies and bureaucracies, not least the
Realm. Chaos is most obviously epitomized by the Wyld, the destruction wrought
by Abyssals and their un-kind, and the Maker’s sickness, but also by the Age
of Sorrows itself, civil war, heresies, barbarians and the like. Discordians
tweak things to try to keep it all in balance and unbalance, as best they can,
in their own way. Those who travel in the bastions of Creation will tend to
provoke disruption and confusion, whereas those who venture towards the wilds
and the Wyld try to get things a bit more organized.

It is unclear why more of the Erisian Exalts are appearing now (or how many of
them there are), but one possibility is that, since so much of Creation fell
to the Wyld after the First Age, they have been spending time out there
attempting to redress the balance, and are returning now that some plans are
coming to fruition. They may have had a hand or three in Autochthon’s return,
to speed this up, or they may be here to interfere with the rise in
orderliness which will inevitably accompany him. On a less cosmic level, they
could be taking advantage of the disruption in the Realm to modify the power
structures. A single central Empire isn’t the only metastable possibility,
surely? These and other motivations are not mutually exclusive, given the
subtly disorganized organizations involved. Plus, just because they’re
increasingly coming to the notice of other powers now, doesn’t mean they
haven't been active for some time.

=== Society

[verse, unknown, Principia Discordia]
``Some of our bishops have a one-man cabal.
Some work together. Some never do explain.''

There is no single organized Discordian social structure--or at least, that’s
what they claim. There are, however, a few disorganized groups who come
together for temporary projects, discussion of long-term plans for the
Universe, and bowling nights. When they do form groups, these are generally
referred to as cabals, rather than circles; except, of course, that they are
generally not referred to.  (Not to be confused with the cabals of those
upstart Infernals, mind you, unless such confusion is useful.)

Discordians like to inveigle themselves into existing structures, the better
to subvert them.  They carry something resembling the Sidereals’ Arcane Fate,
which makes this somewhat easier. Although they may keep up one persona for a
few years, or revisit one over an extended period, some travel widely and come
up with new guises in each location.

==== Organizations

Some of the less obscure titles and societies are briefly described
here.

*The Austral Illuminati:* This society claims to have influence over
most of the southern part of Creation and beyond, manipulating events so
as to bring the ``light of confusion'' to as many people (and Fair Folk)
as possible. Intercepted communications bearing their seal (a triangle
of green jade with a carving of an eye) suggest that they have covert
influence in the south within the Guild, some Realm outposts, and some
of the more settled Delzhan tribes, and are looking to extend their
reach. Of course, they might be lying. Membership is by invitation only,
or by burying a donation of sufficiently high Resources value in a
location known only to oneself, and then forgetting that location.

*The Ersatz Heterarch:* This title describes a single person, but in
fact there seem to be a number of people using it--perhaps as many as a
hundred, although clearly not all are Exalted. Some are mortal mystics
with an appropriate miseducation, a number of sorcerers among them. The
members of this group have taken it upon themselves to find, test and
train those claiming to be newly Exalted by Eris. After all, when the
defining traits of those drawn to the goddess of discord include
confusion and deception, you can’t be too careful. They rely as much on
networks of contacts as on magical means to find these random factors,
but seem to have more luck than the Wyld Hunt have in tracking Solars.
The nature of their tests is unclear, but rumored to be painful. They
claim to be attempting to assess all Erisian exalts and organize them
into one big network with the most suitable people (according to their
tests) in charge. Secretly they are looking for the coming of one known
as the Reverend Mother, who they believe will explain everything for
them.

*The Party for More Parties:* A loose collection of criminals, rebels
and greedy politicians, this organization is funded and supplied by
Discordians from three different cabals, and works to subvert existing
political groups.

Some time ago, *[TODO: invent name here--3rd or Indivisibles]* went into the
Wyld in the far north-east of creation, and returned with a number of
mutations. She cured herself of most of these, but failed to realize she had
also become a Plague Carrier. Those who succumbed to the illness (including
herself, for a time) found that one of their group loyalties was gradually
reversed, until they were driven to form an opposing group. After an
irritating few months in which she harried her own cabal at every turn, they
managed to pin her down and extract the disease spirit. Impressed with the
upheaval she had left in her wake, they kept the spirit alive rather than
``curing'' it, and have seeded it into a number of slaves and prostitutes
owned by the Guild. Its low virulence means that it is most often spread
through intimate contact, so they try to arrange as many Dragon-Blooded orgies
as they can, but it will sometimes spread more freely. See
<<Disease_Contratriety>> in the section on <<Panoply_Diseases>>.

*The Five-Fingered Hand:* The name of this organization is a term used
in jest, even by conspiracy theorists among Sidereals, to refer to some
real or hypothetical organization making a comically clumsy attempt at
intrigue and secrecy. Ironically, however, its real meaning is that of
an object hidden in plain sight, and the society really does exist. Its
fingers number quite a few more than five, and its members infiltrate or
influence the pies of various other secret or secretive societies: The
White Veil Society, the Guild, the All-Seeing Eye, and even one or two
of the less mainstream Sidereal groups, among others. They don’t have
any specific interests of their own to protect; their only agenda is to
sow confusion among those who try to stay hidden, and expose some of
their operations, one way or another, publicly and irrevocably. Given
the riskiness of such undertakings, recruits normally only ever
undertake one mission in a given area, and the mortal and even
Dragon-Blooded among them have a shorter than average life expectancy.
Not only madmen sign up; also those driven by revenge for
assassinations, frustration at ambitions thwarted, or escaped slaves who
have no other life left. The ``members'' of the Hand are often not fully
aware of what they’ve been recruited into, and none know the identity of
its leader or leaders.

Other groups whose names prompt uneasy twinges of recognition in the few to
have heard of them include the Apple Corps, a loose mercenary
brother-and-sisterhood, and the Xaos Liberation Front, whose ostensible agenda
is to agitate for the rights of Elementals and Terrestrial gods

==== Cabals

*The House of Mirrors:* This group of Erisians publicly seeks to extend her
influence among all people, by spreading knowledge about her and encouraging
faith in her ideals (while vainly trying to discourage direct worship). They
keep a low profile and start small cults in widely-spread locations, trying to
present her as simply a goddess of the Age of Sorrows. These followers don’t
oppose worship of other gods, though they make a point of not sticking to the
Immaculate calendar for such things, to the irritation of Yu-Shan’s
accountants. They have even made some inroads into the lower ranks of the
Guild, whose members inevitably read greed and selfishness into the ``do
whatever you want'' philosophy espoused. The cabal is greatly aided in its
efforts by the manse from which they take their name--see
<<Manse_The_House_of_Mirrors>>.

*The Friends of Sessen Douji:* *[TODO]*
