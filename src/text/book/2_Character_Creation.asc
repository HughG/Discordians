=== [Thematics]

Discordians are not heroes; they would rather be iconoclasts than icons.
Like all Exalted, they do certain things amazingly well, but mostly they
just do their own thing.

They are not Solars. In battle they’re as likely to sneak off after
they’ve started a conflict, as to lead a glorious charge. They do not
stand with the gods, except to make funny faces behind their backs.

They are not Lunars. They may shape societies, but they seek balance
rather than victory or survival. They’re certainly no stewards, either,
favoring the sociological equivalent of throwing a spanner or some clogs
in the works--for their own good, you understand--then legging it.

They are not the Dragon-Blooded. They are Princes only of themselves,
and usually quite Maculate. They don’t pass on their exaltation through
breeding, as far as any one knows. Wouldn’t turn down a good orgy,
though.

They are not the Sidereals. True, they have some power over the Loom of
Fate, but they are just as adept at bending any form of Reality to their
whims, in a modest way. Also, they would only work in a large
forward-planning organization if it were necessary to counter an
overdose of disorganization somewhere: they’re only bureaucrats if it
suits them.

They are certainly not the Abyssals. Death and rebirth are part of the
balance they hum along to, but the idea of total Oblivion is at once
horrific and laughable to them.

They are not the Alchemicals. Autochthon may have had a hand in their
creation, perhaps unwittingly, but they certainly don’t follow the
templates of his Chosen and Built. They are nonetheless found within his
body, for the struggle between the Eight Nations on one hand, and the
Gremlins playing out the Maker’s sickness on the other, is just the sort
of trouble which attracts them. Plus, there’s all those cool toys.

They are not the Infernals, either. It’s possible that they are born of
some Primordial-level power but, if so, it’s not one grieving over and
railing against some unjust binding. Their sense of Virtue is much
closer to the mortal norm, too (as long as you include madmen).

So, what are they, then? They are mischief-makers and mystics,
tricksters and eccentrics, anarchists and clowns, who see their own
truths with such unquestioned conviction that they gradually bend the
world to fit them. Loki, Coyote, V, Don Quixote, the Fool of the
Tarot--these are some of their counterparts in our myths.

They are women and men who have touched enlightenment, and found that it
has stuck to them for some reason, but see their own humanity all the
more clearly for it. They are possessed of the typical Virtues, but also
extol such alternatives as Laziness, Impatience and Hubris. Champions of
free will, they will gladly force it on others, whether they like it or
not.

=== (TODO: Converted Discordians?)

I had an idea of something like akuma for Discordians. If becoming an
Erisian is about learning to see the world differently, perhaps those
already Exalted could be converted, just as mortals can. This might
explain existence of a few Discordians in the First Age. I’m imagining
that this conversion doesn’t last past re-incarnation, so the Exaltation
returns to its original state on the death of the host. The next
recipient might gain some unusual memories, though.

This would need proper character creation rules. I was thinking maybe
new Charms learned would replace old ones, by way of conversion. The
most powerful Charms would be lost first, and used to buy less powerful
Charms in the new Charm trees. I’m imagining that no new Charms can be
bought until all old ones have been converted, though the character need
not convert them all at once. That’s a bit of a random idea, and I’d
need to say what would happen to Combos involving them.

Also I’m not sure what would happen to existing anima powers, attuned
artifacts made of no-longer-suitable magical materials etc.
