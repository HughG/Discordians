== Character Creation

[verse, Jan van Stijevoort]
``That man lives best who’s fain
to live half mad, half sane.''

Creating a character for an Exalted game generally involves finding the seed
of an epic hero or villain--not so for the Chosen of Eris.  Discordians are
neither, and would rather be iconoclasts than icons.  Like all Exalted, they
do certain things amazingly well, and may be individuals of remarkable
character, but they are chosen when circumstance brings them to see the world
in a new way, and mostly they follow that inspiration and just do their own
thing.  They have no well-known place in the world as Exalted, and their new
insight is apt to shake the solid ground they thought they stood on as
mortals.  Eris herself will provide little or no help, but your character and
her cabal may head out on a path which leads them by various would-be allies.
Ultimately, they will have to work it out for themselves--with great power
comes, sadly, no instruction manual.

=== Creation Process

The process of creating a character to play is not a straightforward one,
despite the unavoidably linear structure of this chapter, and inspiration may
come to you any any point.  You should treat the following steps as a
framework, and need not follow them in strict order.

==== Step One: Character Concept

The first is to formulate a basic character concept--a sentence or two
describing occupation, goals, values and quirks.  Discuss this with your
Storyteller to work out how this concept will fit into or influence the kind
of series which is planned.  Talking to other players may also help,
particularly in terms of working out how you may have come to know each other.

You should also find out what, if anything, your Storyteller has decided about
the origins of Eris.  This could affect many things, from the experience of
Exaltation, to your character's Motivation, and the attitudes of other power
groups and types of Exalt.

===== Revelation

Any of the typical character and story themes for Exalted may be applicable,
but you will also need to decide what incident or insight led to your
character's Exaltation, and how he or she is likely to relate to the world
thereafter.  This may be connected to the position your character held in the
world up to that point, or may have been prompted by some entirely
unforeseeable event.  Your choice in this area will typically feed into your
choice of Motivation and Division.

===== Motivation

Whatever your character suddenly came to understand, it changed her view of
the world around her.  This may have strengthened, altered, or twisted the
sort of Motivation she had as a mortal, or it may set her off in a new
direction which would seem entirely unrelated, to any onlooker.  Her
Motivation need not be driven entirely or even largely by her revelation, but
it is likely to be at least somewhat colored by it.

===== Division

Divisions are the Discordian equivalent of the Castes of other Exalted.  The
choice here has some influence over what your character can do best, and the
magical powers he can wield, but less so than for those other types of Exalt.
Instead, it has more to do with your character's personality.  The Discordian
Divisions are related to certain viewpoints on the relationship between the
inner and outer lives of sentient beings, their relationship to each other and
the worlds around them, and their higher and lower purposes in life.  These
Divisional themes are broad and players should not feel too restricted in how
their concept fits with them, but they are intended to give your character
more depth if you play around with them.  This focus and the character
creation mechanics mean that it is less important for Erisians to have a
spread of Divisions in a cabal than it might be for other Exalted to balance
castes.

===== Parametadivision

Lastly, you can select a Parametadivision for your character.  Each mimics a
particular kind of Exalt or other powerful being, so it may be relevant if
your character would benefit from posing as or moving freely among members of
some such group.  The choice is initially optional, and is about the
circumstances of the story, rather than the core of the character.  Therefore,
you should discuss this with the Storyteller and other players--choosing to
mimic a Solar may be inadvisable if your game begins on the Blessed Isle, for
instance.

A player can decide that the character picks, deliberately or subconsciously,
at the moment of Exaltation, or can leave them free to do so reflexively at
some opportune moment.  Bear in mind that your character's Parametadivision
can be changed later through the ritual of Divisional Realignment, described
on <<Divisional_Realignment>>, or by such other means as the Storyteller
invents or permits.  Characters can never return to the state of having no
Parametadivision, however, so later changes cannot happen in an instant.

==== Step Two: Attributes

The Discordian Divisions relate to different ways of understanding and
relating to reality, and thus they influence the channels through which
mortals express those things--their Abilities.  The innate make-up of your
character's mortal and Exalted being, Attributes, are chosen freely as normal
for most Exalts.  Decide the ranking of your character's Physical, Social, and
Mental skills, then allocate eight dots among the most effective group, six
among the next, and four among the least.  Each begins with one free dot and
cannot exceed five at character creation.

==== [Thematics]

Discordians are not heroes; they would rather be iconoclasts than icons.
Like all Exalted, they do certain things amazingly well, but mostly they
just do their own thing.

They are not Solars. In battle they’re as likely to sneak off after
they’ve started a conflict, as to lead a glorious charge. They do not
stand with the gods, except to make funny faces behind their backs.

They are not Lunars. They may shape societies, but they seek balance
rather than victory or survival. They’re certainly no stewards, either,
favoring the sociological equivalent of throwing a spanner or some clogs
in the works--for their own good, you understand--then legging it.

They are not the Dragon-Blooded. They are Princes only of themselves,
and usually quite Maculate. They don’t pass on their exaltation through
breeding, as far as any one knows. Wouldn’t turn down a good orgy,
though.

They are not the Sidereals. True, they have some power over the Loom of
Fate, but they are just as adept at bending any form of Reality to their
whims, in a modest way. Also, they would only work in a large
forward-planning organization if it were necessary to counter an
overdose of disorganization somewhere: they’re only bureaucrats if it
suits them.

They are certainly not the Abyssals. Death and rebirth are part of the
balance they hum along to, but the idea of total Oblivion is at once
horrific and laughable to them.

They are not the Alchemicals. Autochthon may have had a hand in their
creation, perhaps unwittingly, but they certainly don’t follow the
templates of his Chosen and Built. They are nonetheless found within his
body, for the struggle between the Eight Nations on one hand, and the
Gremlins playing out the Maker’s sickness on the other, is just the sort
of trouble which attracts them. Plus, there’s all those cool toys.

They are not the Infernals, either. It’s possible that they are born of
some Primordial-level power but, if so, it’s not one grieving over and
railing against some unjust binding. Their sense of Virtue is much
closer to the mortal norm, too (as long as you include madmen).

So, what are they, then? They are mischief-makers and mystics,
tricksters and eccentrics, anarchists and clowns, who see their own
truths with such unquestioned conviction that they gradually bend the
world to fit them. Loki, Coyote, V, Don Quixote, the Fool of the
Tarot--these are some of their counterparts in our myths.

They are women and men who have touched enlightenment, and found that it
has stuck to them for some reason, but see their own humanity all the
more clearly for it. They are possessed of the typical Virtues, but also
extol such alternatives as Laziness, Impatience and Hubris. Champions of
free will, they will gladly force it on others, whether they like it or
not.
