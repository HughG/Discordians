== Character Creation

[verse, Jan van Stijevoort]
``That man lives best whoâ€™s fain
to live half mad, half sane.''

*[TODO: Check the mechanics here against 2.5 errata.]*

Creating a character for an Exalted game generally involves finding the seed
of an epic hero or villain--not so for the Chosen of Eris.  Discordians are
neither, and would rather be iconoclasts than icons.  Like all Exalted, they
do certain things amazingly well, and may be individuals of remarkable
character, but they are chosen when circumstance brings them to see the world
in a new way, and mostly they follow that inspiration and just do their own
thing.  They have no well-known place in the world as Exalted, and their new
insight is apt to shake the solid ground they thought they stood on as
mortals.  Eris herself will provide little or no help, but your character and
her cabal may head out on a path which leads them by various would-be allies.
Ultimately, they will have to work it out for themselves--with great power
comes, sadly, no instruction manual.

=== Creation Process

The process of creating a character to play is not a straightforward one,
despite the unavoidably linear structure of this chapter, and inspiration may
come to you any any point.  You should treat the following steps as a
framework, and need not follow them in strict order.

==== Step One: Character Concept

The first is to formulate a basic character concept--a sentence or two
describing occupation, goals, values and quirks.  Discuss this with your
Storyteller to work out how this concept will fit into or influence the kind
of series which is planned.  Talking to other players may also help,
particularly in terms of working out how you may have come to know each other.

You should also find out what, if anything, your Storyteller has decided about
the origins of Eris.  This could affect many things, from the experience of
Exaltation, to your character's Motivation, and the attitudes of other power
groups and types of Exalt.

===== Revelation

Any of the typical character and story themes for Exalted may be applicable,
but you will also need to decide what incident or insight led to your
character's Exaltation, and how he or she is likely to relate to the world
thereafter.  This may be connected to the position your character held in the
world up to that point, or may have been prompted by some entirely
unforeseeable event.  Your choice in this area will typically feed into your
choice of Motivation and Division.  Some examples are given in the section on
<<Discordian_Exaltation>>.

Don't feel that you must get this right at character creation.  Although some
parts of your character will be fixed, the core of the Discordian insight is
that there are many Ways, but no One True Way, so you can find ways for the
story to lead your character to successive new fundamental viewpoints in
future.

===== Motivation

Whatever your character suddenly came to understand, it changed her view of
the world around her.  This may have strengthened, altered, or twisted the
sort of Motivation she had as a mortal, or it may set her off in a new
direction which would seem entirely unrelated, to any onlooker.  Her
Motivation need not be driven entirely or even largely by her revelation, but
it is likely to be at least somewhat colored by it.

===== Division

Divisions are the Discordian equivalent of the Castes of other Exalted.  The
choice here has some influence over what your character can do best, and the
magical powers he can wield, but less so than for those other types of Exalt.
Instead, it has more to do with your character's personality.  The Discordian
Divisions are related to certain viewpoints on the relationship between the
inner and outer lives of sentient beings, their relationship to each other and
the worlds around them, and their higher and lower purposes in life.  These
Divisional themes are broad and players should not feel too restricted in how
their concept fits with them, but they are intended to give your character
more depth if you play around with them.  This focus and the character
creation mechanics mean that it is less important for Erisians to have a
spread of Divisions in a cabal than it might be for other Exalted to balance
castes.

===== Parametadivision

Lastly, you can select a Parametadivision for your character.  Each mimics a
particular kind of Exalt or other powerful being, so it may be relevant if
your character would benefit from posing as or moving freely among members of
some such group.  The choice is initially optional, and is about the
circumstances of the story, rather than the core of the character.  Therefore,
you should discuss this with the Storyteller and other players--choosing to
mimic a Solar may be inadvisable if your game begins on the Blessed Isle, for
instance.

A player can decide that the character picks, deliberately or subconsciously,
at the moment of Exaltation, or can leave them free to do so reflexively at
some opportune moment.  Bear in mind that your character's Parametadivision
can be changed later through the ritual of <<Divisional_Realignment>> or by
such other means as the Storyteller invents or permits.  Characters can never
return to the state of having no Parametadivision, however, so later changes
cannot happen in an instant.

==== Step Two: Attributes

The Discordian Divisions relate to different ways of understanding and
relating to reality, and thus they influence the channels through which
mortals express those things--their Abilities.  The innate make-up of your
character's mortal and Exalted being, Attributes, are chosen freely as normal
for most Exalts.  Decide the ranking of your character's Physical, Social, and
Mental skills, then allocate eight dots among the most effective group, six
among the next, and four among the least.  Each begins with one free dot and
cannot exceed five at character creation.

==== Step Three: Abilities

A newly-exalted Erisian chooses _three_ Abilities from her Division as her
Divisonal Abilities, and _five_ others as Favored, which may or may not
include the remaining two Abilities associated with her Division.  Assign a
single dot to each of these, and then a further 18 dots across all of your
character's Abilities.  None may be raised above three dots at this
point--that can only be done later when bonus points are spent.

The Abilities associated with each Division are as follows.  Bear in mind that
your choices are freer than with other kinds of Exalted, since you need not
choose any more than three Abilities associated with your character's
Division.

*Anchor Abilities* make the singular wanderer self-sufficient: Athletics,
Awareness, Martial Arts, Sail, and Survival.

*Arrow Abilities* connect the high-strung lovers with the focus of their
attentions: Archery, Investigation, Medicine, Performance, and Ride.

*Apple Abilities* feed the strife and synergy that the glorious Corpsmen stir
up around themselves: Linguistics, Melee, Presence, Socialize, and War.

*Archway Abilities* lean the borderline watchers toward approaching things
from different sides and angles: Dodge, Larceny, Occult, Thrown, and Stealth.

*Anvil Abilities* support the high-handed regulators in making sure that
systems and strucures run as they see fit: Bureaucracy, Craft, Integrity,
Lore, Resistance.

==== Step Four: Advantages

From their own point of view, Erisian Exalts bear the advantages and
disadvantages of their inescapable freedom.  Mechanically, they are created
with the same advantages as other beings of power in the world of
Exalted--more supporting Backgrounds than most mortals will ever know, access
to a quirky but powerful set of Charms, and more-or-less the same Virtues as
anyone else.

===== Backgrounds

Discordians have access to the Backgrounds described in <<Exalted>>, p. 110,
and also some normally only available to other kinds of Exalt, as they wangle
their ways into places they don't belong.  Some of these Backgrounds function
differently for Discordians, and they have a couple of their own, as described
in the section on <<Backgrounds>>.

===== Charms

At least five of the 10 Charms which a Discordian knows at Exaltation must be
related to her chosen Divisional or Favored Abilites, with the remaining five
chosen from any Ability.  True to their whimsical and idiosyncratic nature,
every Discordian Charm tree contains some Charms which stretch the meaning of
the Ability, and which other Exalts might associate with a different Ability.
As with any character, therefore, it pays somewhat to consider at generation
time what Charms you think your character may want to learn later.

===== Virtues

Of all the Exalted, Eris' Chosen are perhaps the most human, and their Virtues
are the familiar four mortal ones.  Each begins with a single free dot, and
you have five more to allocate among them.  Although they eschew the
transhumanism of some Infernals, Solars, and the like, Discordians can't
resist having their own take on just about any matter, and the Charm
<<Integrity_iiov>> allows them to refine their Virtues in peculiar ways.

Eris somehow arranged for her Chosen to sidestep the Great Curse--or perhaps
they were just lucky--but the strain of containing the power of an Exaltation
still leaks out at times in ways which are partly related to her Virtues.
Choose one Virtue rated at least three dots as your chracter's primary Virtue,
and see the section on <<Hodge_and_Podge>> for more information.

==== Step Five: Finishing Touches

The remaining traits of Willpower, Intimacies, Essence, and Health Levels are
discussed last, since they depend on some of your previous choices.  Bonus
points are available to push your character past the basics in certain areas
of your choice.

===== Willpower

A Discordian's Willpower rating is the sum of his two highest virtues, to a
maximum of 7 unless at least two Virtues are rated 4 or higher.  Spending
Willpower to exercise or resist unnatural mental influence is the other thing
which upsets the character's balance of <<Hodge_and_Podge>>, as the
contradiction of allowing some beings to exercise freedom while taking it from
others plays on his supercharged soul.

===== Intimacies

Intimacies are chosen as normal for any character, as described in
<<Exalted>>, p. 76 and p. 90.  Discordians are perhaps more likely than others
to want to change their Intimacies, though they find it no easier, and various
of their Charms relate to Intimacies.

===== Essence and Essence Pools

Though none in Yu-Shan has taken responsibility for creating them, the
self-proclaimed Chosen of Eris are equivalent to Celestial Exalted, and begin
with a permanent Essence rating of 2.

The Personal Essence pool for a Discordian contains a number of motes equal to
his Essence times two-and-a-half, plus his permanent Willpower.  The larger
Peripheral Essence pool contains motes equal to his Essence times five, plus
his Willpower, plus the sum of his Virtues.

===== Health Levels

As with any new Exalt, a Discordian has seven Health Levels--one at a -0
wound penalty, two at -1, two at -2, one at -4 and one Incapacitated.  Further
levels may be added by purchasing the Charm <<Resistance_cbt>>.

==== Bonus Points

Eris leaves her Chosen with little clue of what to do next, and no obvious
support, but she does send them off into the world with a little more of a
kick than other Exalted.  You have--of course--23 bonus points to spend on
improving your character's ability to tackle the world from his or her chosen
standpoint.

==== Spark of Life

Now, with all the numbers neatly totted up, what remains is to add a measure
of spirit.  Consider who your character really is, and what it is like to be
him.

*Life Before:* The majority of Exaltations come to their hosts in young
adulthood, and Discordians by and large follow this tendency.  So, what had
your character been doing up till then?  Where was he born, and to what
family?  Is he a native of the Realm or one of its satrapies, or of barbarian
stock on the fringes of Creation, or perhaps some other world further afield?
What pressures of politics, society, or simple survival shaped his formative
years?  Bear in mind that, since Discordian are not chosen for their heroic or
horrific potential, their early life may not have been particularly dramatic,
at least not in an obvious way.

*Revelation:* You will likely have already given some thought to what
third-eye-opening experience visited your character's Exaltation upon him--now
you may also want to consider his reactions to it.  In the moment, he may have
been delighted, terrified, or simply bemused.  As it starts to play out in his
daily life, and given some time for reflection, how does he feel about it now?
He may embrace the inevitable consequences he sees for himself and others, or
fear them--and it may color his view of those things he has held dear so far.

*Ambitions:* A quotidian life before Exaltation need not have been empty of
aspirations--or, of course, your character may have had some power and
influence as a mortal already.  In any case, his attitude to his goals is
likely to have changed, either because they themselves have changed, or
because he sees novel ways to achieve them.

*Relationships:* Some Exalted are hounded as anathema and lose their homes
while struggling to protect their loved ones, whereas others are simply
shunned by now-nervous colleagues and neighbours.  Discordians may manage to
conceal themselves as mortals for some time, but the new-found beliefs they
carry will change their personal relationships even if circumstances don't
force the issue.  How have these ties, and those represented by Backgrounds,
begun to change for your character?  Has he had need to make use of his
Recumbent Destiny, and has that interfered with some of the connections he
had, or made particularly interesting ripples around him?

*Cabal:* You should also talk with your Storyteller and other players about
how your cabal came to form.  It's been known for a handful of people who knew
each other as mortals, if only loosely, to Exalt at the same time, perhaps
with different reactions to the same pivotal observation.  Maybe chance will
have brought you together, but there's a better chance that one or more of the
sketchy societies claiming allegiance to Eris Discordia will have introduced
you to each other--purely for your own good, of course.

*Little Details:* Hairstyle, personality quirks, favourite foods, the name of
his dog--all these are bits of icing on the multi-layered cake which is your
character.  If none of these have come to mind for you during all the previous
steps, it's worth inlcuding one or two points like these.

==== [Thematics]

Discordians are not heroes; they would rather be iconoclasts than icons.
Like all Exalted, they do certain things amazingly well, but mostly they
just do their own thing.

They are not Solars. In battle theyâ€™re as likely to sneak off after
theyâ€™ve started a conflict, as to lead a glorious charge. They do not
stand with the gods, except to make funny faces behind their backs.

They are not Lunars. They may shape societies, but they seek balance
rather than victory or survival. Theyâ€™re certainly no stewards, either,
favoring the sociological equivalent of throwing a spanner or some clogs
in the works--for their own good, you understand--then legging it.

They are not the Dragon-Blooded. They are Princes only of themselves,
and usually quite Maculate. They donâ€™t pass on their exaltation through
breeding, as far as any one knows. Wouldnâ€™t turn down a good orgy,
though.

They are not the Sidereals. True, they have some power over the Loom of
Fate, but they are just as adept at bending any form of Reality to their
whims, in a modest way. Also, they would only work in a large
forward-planning organization if it were necessary to counter an
overdose of disorganization somewhere: theyâ€™re only bureaucrats if it
suits them.

They are certainly not the Abyssals. Death and rebirth are part of the
balance they hum along to, but the idea of total Oblivion is at once
horrific and laughable to them.

They are not the Alchemicals. Autochthon may have had a hand in their
creation, perhaps unwittingly, but they certainly donâ€™t follow the
templates of his Chosen and Built. They are nonetheless found within his
body, for the struggle between the Eight Nations on one hand, and the
Gremlins playing out the Makerâ€™s sickness on the other, is just the sort
of trouble which attracts them. Plus, thereâ€™s all those cool toys.

They are not the Infernals, either. Itâ€™s possible that they are born of
some Primordial-level power but, if so, itâ€™s not one grieving over and
railing against some unjust binding. Their sense of Virtue is much
closer to the mortal norm, too (as long as you include madmen).

So, what are they, then?  They are mischief-makers and mystics, tricksters and
eccentrics, anarchists and clowns, who see their own truths with such
unquestioned conviction, or flexibility of interpretation, that they gradually
bend the world to fit them. Don Quixote, V, Coyote, the Fool of the
Tarot--these are some of their counterparts in our myths.

They are women and men who have touched enlightenment, and found that it
has stuck to them for some reason, but see their own humanity all the
more clearly for it. They are possessed of the typical Virtues, but also
extol such alternatives as Laziness, Impatience and Hubris. Champions of
free will, they will gladly force it on others, whether they like it or
not.
