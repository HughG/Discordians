=== Divisions

[verse]
``Divide and conquer!''

indexterm:[-,Divisions]Where other Exalted split themselves into Castes,
Erisians take the more direct route and call these splits
``Divisions''. Followers of the Most Beautiful will of course proclaim
allegiance to all sorts of other organizations, as it suits them; but these
more fundamental classifications come from the powers granted to them by That
Woman, and are based on how they relate to themselves and the rest of
reality. Each Division has a Divisional mark, five favored Abilities and a
number of anima powers. The names and symbols of the Divisions are intuitively
understood by all Erisian Exalted, but so far few others recognize them.  The
Immaculates, if they were to see a Discordian truly, would know him as
Anathema but have no specific appellations beyond that; their sobriquets are
names they have invented for themselves.

Besides the nature inherent to their Exaltation, each also belongs to a
Parametadivision, which mimics and has an Affinity with one of the other
Exalted types, or some other group of powerful beings. This alignment
provides additional anima powers and has an associated Erisian Element
and, in most cases, a magical material. Some Parametadivisions may
provide other specific additions or changes to traits and powers. Under
certain circum­stances, a character’s Parametadivision can change.

==== Discordian Anima

indexterm:[-,Anima]Each Division has an anima with a particular color. As a
character expends Peripheral Essence, this anima shows itself, first simply as
a mark on the forehead, then as a subtle amorphous glow, and eventually as a
vivid bonfire of light. As the brightness increases to higher levels, its glow
includes some iconic imagery unique to the character.

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|====
|Motes of Peripheral Essence |Effects
|1-3|
The Divisional mark glitters on the character’s forehead and may be seen
from some angles. A successful (Perception &#x2B; Awareness) roll at
difficulty 3 allows a character to notice the symbol. The symbol can be
covered to prevent it being noticed.
|4-7|
The mark glows brighter, reducing the difficulty of the (Perception
&#x2B; Awareness) roll to 1.
|8-10|
The mark burns brightly and is evident to any who see it, though it may
still be covered. Natural attempts at stealth are at &#x2B;2 difficulty,
though Charms still function as normal. The character is surrounded by a
dim glow, visible in darkness or against contrasting colors. It shows
none of the character’s iconic anima imagery.
|11-15|
The Divisional mark shines through any concealment, and the dim glow
around the character increases to a bright light making the character
clearly visible up to 20-30 yards away, providing enough light to read
by up to 2-3 yards. Hints of the character’s iconic imagery appear and
disappear around the fringes of the glow. Stealth is impossible,
including use of Charms or other magic.
|16&#x2B;|
In every action in which the character spends motes, the anima glow
flares up to a bonfire, clearly showing its iconic imagery. The light is
sufficient to read by up to 10 yards and the character can be seen up to
a mile away. The glow subsides to the previous level in any action in
which the character does not spend peripheral Essence.
|====

In addition, every Discordian can activate the following common anima
effects.

* By spending 1 mote she can cause her Divisional mark to glow brightly
for a scene, as if having spent 8-10 motes of Peripheral Essence (though
this does not cause anima flare).

[[Division_1,1st Division]]
==== 1st Division: Anchor

indexterm:[-, Divisions, 1st Division (Anchor)]Those in the Anchor Division
find their inspiration and power in instincts and impulses. They are
half-emergent from the mud, grounded and fluid, self-aware of their borderless
selves. They can be undefeatable, not because they can withstand all comers
but because they do not observe the division between self and opponent.

Common choices of Parametadivision would be Good from Bad, Night from
Day, the Sub-Division or even the Indivisibles. Like Solars they are
full of belief in their own power and righteousness, more because they
ignore others than because they set themselves above everyone else. Like
Lunars they are creatures of sometimes animal instinct. And like the
Yozi and their Chosen, they can tend to see the world through a focus of
their own beliefs, failing to understand others. In some cases they may
even have some connection with raksha, where they are low in Graces, or
in bedlam.

*Symbol:* TODO

*Anima color:* Orange

*Anima effects:* By spending 5 motes, an Anchorite can enhance their
self-focus to unnatural levels. The player rolls (Essence) dice and subtracts
the number of successes from all internal penalties of any sort (e.g., from
wounds) for the rest of the scene. This effect applies automatically once his
anima banner reaches the 8-10 mote level.

*Associations:* Id, pre-conscious desire; Narcissus, being-one; focus,
self-sustenance; thoughtless selfishness

*Sobriquets:* The Most Beautiful, Anchorites, The Voices Whistling in the
Dark, The Ignorant Children, The Traveling Sailsmen, Monks of the Inaccurate
Order

*Concepts:* itinerant hermit, martial monk, long-distance sailor,
barbarian hunter, watchman, woods­man, explorer

*Abilities:* Athletics, Awareness, Martial Arts, Sail, Survival

*Quote:* ``Make me one with everything.''

[[Division_2,2nd Division]]
==== 2nd Division: Arrow

indexterm:[-, Divisions, 2nd Division (Arrow)]The Arrows of Eris pierce the
boundary of the self, bridging the inner and outer aspects of being. They
understand that to achieve one’s own goals, one must gain the help of others,
and work round or co-opt their desires. They can be beguiling and friendly but
are ready to bring their manipulations to a sharper focus if necessary to get
to the heart of the matter.

Popular Parametadivisions for these characters are Night from Day, Might
from Will and the Indivisibles: Lunars, Sidereals and raksha (with
sufficient Grace) are often consummate manipulators, each in their own
way.

*Symbol:* TODO

*Anima color:* Pink

*Anima effects:* By spending 5 motes, a Mirror-Bearer can skilfully read the
desires of those around her. For the rest of the scene, she gains a bonus
number of dice equal to her Essence on any Investigation or Socialize rolls
for Reading Motivation of a single subject. The bonus may apply to multiple
rolls targeting separate individuals in a scene, but does not apply to any
single roll targeting more than one being. This bonus is not included in the
limit for dice added by Charms. This effect applies automatically once her
anima banner reaches the 8-10 mote level.

*Associations:* Ego, negotiation and persuasion; conscious and
compromising desire; lovers, becoming-one; curiosity; self-sacrifice;
loneliness

*Sobriquets:* Matchmakers, The Soft and Steady Hand, The Mirror-Bearers,
The Heart-Strung, Puppeteers

*Concepts:* treasure-hunter, wandering bard or clown, state inquisitor,
hedge-wizard, evangelical missionary, _agent provocateur_

*Abilities:* Archery, Investigation, Medicine, Performance, Ride

[[Division_3,3rd Division]]
==== 3rd Division: Apple

indexterm:[-, Divisions, 3rd Division (Apple)]The Apples of Eris’ eye are made
to be seen and tasted, as an inspiration and a focus of action. They throw
themselves into the midst of situations and are at home in conflict, whether
or not it is of their own making. The leaders, fighters and executive action
brigade of the Discordians, this Division makes things happen by organizing,
persuading, confusing or, if necessary, hitting large numbers of people until
they act together. To this end they will apply or disregard rules and
restrictions as suits them.

These Chosen may find themselves drawn to the Parametadivisions of Good
from Bad, Seed from Tree or Blood from Stone slightly more than others.
Solars are the ultimate imposing Exalted and designed to be leaders. The
Dragon-Blooded have fulfilled that role reasonably in the Second Age,
and the Realm is an impressively well-organized society, if ripe for
stirring up. Alchemical Exalted are ``born'' to lead their people, too, in
practical terms and as inspirations.

*Symbol:* TODO

*Anima color:* Pale green

*Anima effects:* By spending 5 motes, the soldiers of the Apple Corps can
enhance the abilities of those working with them, choosing a single Ability to
enhance for a given scene. During each action the character takes, he has a
pool of (Essence x 2) dice which he can add to any roll (or static
calculation, like DV) involving the selected Ability by any other being within
(Essence x 5) yards.  In mass combat valid targets for this assistance are
unit of which the character is a member, and its commander and any special
characters as individuals. The dice may be split among multiple actions by
multiple beings, but the total dice added to any roll may not exceed normal
limits for the target. If the target is a mortal or of some other kind which
does not have powers to add dice up to a limit, the Discordian limit
calculation is used, with the target’s traits.  This dice pool is refreshed at
the start of the character’s next action. This effect activates automatically
once the character’s anima is flaring at the 11-15 mote level.

*Associations:* Super-ego; virtue, law; team­work, competition;
community, pride; strife, jealousy

*Sobriquets:* The Apple Corps, Tower-Builders, Taskmasters, Overseers,
Offendis

*Concepts:* Realm Talon-leader, ambitious war-lord, influential
courtier, Confederation of Rivers diplomat, popular foreman

*Abilities:* Linguistics, Melee, Presence, Socialize, War

[[Division_4,4th Division]]
==== 4th Division: Archway

indexterm:[-, Divisions, 4th Division (Archway)]They who stand in the Archway
are those who cannot help but notice the gaps, correspondences and short-cuts
between one thing and another. The place they stand connects the physical and
the immaterial, the seen and the unseen, the here and there, the realms of
reality, the truth and the other truth. They seek to uncover mundane and
mystical secrets and understanding, sometimes to set themselves above others,
other times to set them free. They are often peripherally involved in multiple
sizable covert organizations or networks, to spy on, subvert or control them.
Exalted of this Division count as priests, though that does not automatically
make them Holy.

The most obvious choices of Parametadivision for these Exalts are those
of Might from Will and the Sub-Division, but Night from Day and the
Indivisi­bles are not uncommon. Sidereals work with one of the most
powerful magical underpinnings of everyday Creation, and they are
themselves obscured, since the breaking of the Mask. Infernals have made
much of their preparations in secret, hidden away from mortals, but are
working to bridge once of the greatest magical gaps of all. Lunars and
raksha alike are found on the fringes of Creation where it unwinds into
the Wyld fabric from which it was wrought.

*Symbol:* TODO

*Anima color:* Indigo

*Anima effects:* Spending 5 motes gives the Gatekeeper insight into how to
bypass barriers, for the rest of the scene. This grants her a bonus number of
dice equal to her Essence on Larceny attempts to pick locks, or on appropriate
rolls (e.g., Perception &#x2B; Occult, Intelligence &#x2B; Lore) to understand
how to open artifact doors, mystical portals etc. It will only help her
sidestep a barrier, or open it in an appropriate manner, not break through or
destroy a barrier, though it may help her understand whether that is the only
option available to her.  This power does not directly reveal the location of
hidden portals, but the knowledge of how to open them may be sufficient, or
may imply their location. On the other hand, knowledge may not be enough: the
Gatekeeper may learn that the quartermaster’s key will open the door, but will
not magically gain the key. At the Storyteller's discretion, the character may
also use her anima power to help bypass specific obstacles in social or
bureacratic situations--these could be opposing actions by other characters,
or processes designed to prevent or restrict people from achieving some end.
In melee and mass combat this power reduces by -1 any bonuses a target gains
to his DV from shields or cover.  These effects applies automatically once her
anima banner reaches the 11-15 mote level.

*Associations:* Collective unconscious; mystery, learning, confusion;
flexibility; transgression, duplicity

*Sobriquets:* They Who Stand in the Doorway, The Gatekeepers, The
Unhinged, Mid-day Shadows, Invaders of the Faith

*Concepts:* practicing mystic, escapologist and knife-thrower, crime
lord, cult activist, spy-master or double agent, demon-summoner

*Abilities:* Dodge, Larceny, Occult, Thrown, Stealth

*Quote:* ``The Grey Illusion is that all realms of reality have their
underlying rules.  The Erisian Illusion is that they have none.''

<<<
[[Division_5,5th Division]]
==== 5th Division: Anvil

indexterm:[-, Divisions, 5th Division (Anvil)]The Chosen of this Division are
defined by their awareness of the structures and patterns which suffuse and
support all things, large and small. Even in the Wyld, the shifting stories of
the raksha have their own narrative rules; even Oblivion has its own
ever-expanding shape, and a subtle texture to the screams which echo from its
maw.

The systems they work with are the same ones the Archway poke holes
through. The Authority struggles at times to remember that order is as
much an illusion and an invention of the mind as chaos, but finds it
convenient to use the flaws in every system to chisel and beat the world
into shape on the Anvil of themselves. Some gleefully oppose the
Chaos-bringing efforts of other Discordian Exalted. As one of their many
holy books said: ``Eristic Avatars are sent down into Creation, for the
purpose of keeping things from becoming so well ordered that they stop
working. This they often accomplish by insisting that certain arbitrary
interpretations of reality are the only valid ones. That causes Strife
which results in Confusion which revitalizes Holy Chaos.''

The Parametadivision of Blood from Stone and the Division of Labor
attract many of the Architects, with others not infrequently choosing
Seed from Tree or, perhaps surprisingly, the Indivisibles. Alchemicals
are crafted by the Maker, so the building of structures is in what
passes for their blood. The Mountain Folk are rigid in themselves, and
bound. The Realm and its outposts is one of the most visible
organizations in Creation, if not always the most effective. Lastly, the
raksha claim to abhor form but cannot help playing with it, and even the
great unshaped are aware of it in some part of their being.

*Symbol:* TODO

*Anima color:* Grey

*Anima effects:* By spending 5 motes reflexively, a figure of Authority can
take advantage of the web of connections in his life.  His anima power allows
him to transfer all external penalties from a single source for the scene,
moving them off himself into his relationship with a specific being or group
via one of his Backgrounds.  Transferring penalties to a group via Abyssal
Command, Backing, Command, Cult, Followers, Henchmen, or Spies applies the
penalties to the relevant group instead.  Transferring penalties via Allies,
Class, Contacts, Echoes, Familiar, Family, Influence, Mentor, Past Life,
Pineal Gland, or Whispers instead applies an equal internal penalty to the
character's attempts to use that Background.  Dots of any Background available
through Liege or Infamy can also be used, and only that specific Background is
affected, not the Liege or Infamy Background itself.  The Sifu Background can
also be used, which not only prevents the character from receiving training,
but applies an internal penalty to any actions by the character involving
Charms learned from the Sifu.

The character can transfer penalties from a single source to a single
Background, and cannot transfer more points than he has dots in that
Background.  For example, if the character faces a -4 external penalty and
chooses to transfer it into his three-dot Backing with the local Guild
headquarters, that organization will suffer a -3 external penalty while the
character continues to suffer a one-point penalty.  If penalties from the
chosen source increase later in the scene, points continue to be transferred
until the total number of dots in that Background is reached.  If the
character has dots in a single Background which relate to multiple
entites--for example, Backing in several organizations--then all entites are
affected.  The transferred penalties persist beyond the current scene,
reducing at the rate of one point per week.  Any interaction with an affected
group or individual, or attempts to use an affected Background, will delay the
recovery by a further week.

The character can activate his anima power multiple times in a scene, or
across multiple scenes, to avert penalties from several sources concurrently.
However, he cannot transfer penalties to any one Background more than once--he
must wait until the relationship has healed.  The cost of this power does not
decrease as the character's peripheral mote expenditure increases.  Instead,
the cost decreases by one on each additional use during a scene, to a minimum
of one.

*Associations:* Cultural super-ego, ethics and mores; grey; congruence,
order, control; rigidity, self-imposed blindness

*Sobriquets:* The Architects, The Authority, The Unbending Arm, They Who
Carve Truth in Stone, Eyeless Watchers

*Concepts:* reforming bureaucrat, overly-literal judge, master
blacksmith, honor-driven vigilante, didactic scholar

*Abilities:* Bureaucracy, Craft, Integrity, Lore, Resistance

*Quote:* ``Do not bend. Folding, spindling or mutilating may be permitted

=== Parametadivisions

The Chosen of Eris have been created to sow confusion and discord and, to this
end, are inherently able to mimic one type of Exalt or other powerful being,
according to an aspect known as their Parametadivision.  This is chosen at
character creation time, but may be changed later through the ritual of
Divisional Realignment (see <<Divisional_Realignment>>).

Each type mimicked contains further sub-types--Exalted castes, for
example. The character must choose an initial sub-type to mimic, but may
change this indefinitely at any time by taking a miscellaneous action.
For some Parametadivisions this change may affect ongoing anima effects,
as described in the relevant following section.

If the character changes sub-type she may also change minor details of her
appearance as a Shaping effect. Assuming they recall clearly through the
effects of her Recumbent Destiny, others will not recognize her from her
normal appearance or that of any other of her sub-type forms unless they
succeed on a (Perception &#x2B; Awareness) roll at a difficulty of the
character’s (Essence ÷ 2). They may substitute Investigation or Larceny for
Awareness if they already have reason to suspect the character may not be who
she appears to be. The character may have only one alternative appearance
associated with each sub-type.

This book does not yet contain descriptions of the Parametadivisions which
mimic Dragon Kings, Nocturnals and other remarkable types of beings, but
they'll appear at some point.

==== Anima Mimicry

indexterm:[-,Anima mimcry]
indexterm:[-,Anima,mimcry]
Erisians are able to use their anima appearance and
powers to support their Parametadivisional impersonation of different Exalted
types. Each can at least approximate the outward appearance of the most
significant anima powers of those they impersonate.

When it is visible, Discordians can reflexively, at no cost, make their anima
appear to belong to the Exalted type and caste fitting their
Parameta­divisional Affinity. By spending 3 motes, they can change this
appearance to any other Parameta­divisional type and caste for one
scene. Mimicking another Exalted anima in this way includes the anima getting
brighter at the levels appropriate for that Exalted type, including any
penalties to Stealth and so on. If mimicking a caste which can flare its anima
even further than normal, such as the Solar Zenith or Infernal Malefactor
castes, the character can do the same at the cost of 2 motes, or at no cost
whenever their anima flares at the 16&#x2B; level, though it is a purely
cosmetic effect. For those types whose anima includes iconic imagery, the
image will be different from the character’s Erisian anima, but have something
in common with it.

To aid in infiltrating various power groups, they can commit 5 motes and
1 Willpower to change their apparent Essence signature indefinitely,
regardless of whether their anima is visible (_e.g._, even when they are
asleep), but only according to their Affinity.

Alternatively, they can commit that Essence and Willpower to hide the fact
that they have enlightened Essence at all, making them appear to be an
ordinary mortal of Essence 1 (or, if they normally have Essence 4 or more, a
heroic mortal with Essence 2 and no mote pool). This effect continues even as
the Exalt spends motes, though observers may be able to determine the source
of the power.  Unless they are mimicking the type with which they have an
Affinity, use of an Obvious Charm or an expenditure of 11 or more motes of
their Peripheral Essence causes the effect to end immediately, and the
Willpower is no longer committed.

When their anima appearance is changed in this way, be it for a scene or
indefinitely, magical powers which can determine the type of an Exalt’s
Essence (such as the Solar Charm All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight) will
also perceive the purported type. Attempts to see through this (_e.g._,
using a Charm such as Eye of the Unconquered Sun) add the Exalt’s
Essence to their difficulty or, in the case of a contested roll, the
character adds (Essence) successes. This alteration is a Shaping effect
rather than an Illusion. Effects which prevent Shaping will nonetheless
not prevent this alteration or suppression of apparent anima, unless
they are specifically crafted to that end.

===== Other Affinity Effects

indexterm:[-, Mimicry, Parametadivisonal cosmetic]
indexterm:[-, Mimicry, Cosmetic Charm]In order that they may blend in with
those they are trying to influence, the Affinity of a Discordian also confers
upon them any cosmetic effects which would be appropriate. For example, those
in the Parametadivision called the The Division by Zero will give a fairly
convincing impression of walking corpses, whereas those in the Division of
Night from Day have animal tells, and those in the Division of Seed from Tree
show some of the elemental coloring of the Dragon-Blooded, if their Essence is
high enough.  Furthermore, as described in <<Chapter_4_Charms>>, any
Discordian may cause the Obvious effects of a Charm to mimic those of any
other Charm they know of, from any Exalted or other source.

Those Erisians bearing an apparent Essence signature befitting a
creature of darkness are treated as such, for the purposes of Charms and
other effects. They may take extra damage from Holy effect, for example,
and cannot themselves use Holy Charms, though they may learn them.

[[Parameta_Good_from_Bad,The Division of Good from Bad]]]
==== The Division of Good from Bad

indexterm:[-, Parametadivisions, Good from Bad (Solar)]Erisians of this
Parametadivision take on the mantle of excellence and leadership to reflect
the light of the Solars. They inspire others by example, taking control where
it suits them, pushing and dragging others to where they need to be. Equally
they will shine a light on what they see as wrong or deficient, whether or not
they have an alternative in mind: upheaval is preferable to broken order. They
are rarely hidden, unless that is what they excel in, and unlikely to be
overlooked.

*Element:* Orange

*Magical Material:* Orichalcum

*Affinity:* Solar

*Anima effects:* Common Solar anima effects, at a cost of 1 mote each:

* Cause her caste mark to glow brightly for a scene (as if the character
had spend 4-7 motes of Peripheral Essence).
* Cause her anima to glow brightly enough to read by for a scene (as if
the character had spent 8-10 motes of Peripheral Essence).
* Know the precise time of day for the rest of the scene.

By spending 10 motes, the character can reflect some of the Holy power of the
Solars. For the rest of the scene, she adds (Essence ÷ 2) dice to any kind of
attack or defense roll against creatures of darkness. The anima power actives
automatically once the character spends 11-15 motes of Peripheral Essence.

*Associations:* Beautiful sunsets; scrap-heaps and forges; firebreaks and
scorched earth; perfect self-belief; headstrong leadership

*Sobriquets:* The Law Unto Themselves, The Golden Gifts, Suns of Eris,
Holy Terrors, Brass Monkeys

*Concepts:* ronin, elite palace guard, charismatic king, campaigner for
Elemental rights, rising star of the Guild

*Quote:* ``The Nagas of the South-East Mountain Tribes say that the sun
shines by day because, being a woman, it is afraid to venture out by
night.''

<<<
[[Parameta_Night_from_Day,The Division of Night from Day]]
==== The Division of Night from Day

indexterm:[-, Parametadivisions, Night from Day (Lunar)]The Chosen who take to
this Parametadivision ape the Chosen of Luna and, being born of confusion, are
quite at home in mimicking their volatile natures. They change their forms,
opinions, tactics and allegiances at whim; they will hold at least some more
enduring values and loyalties, but even these are not immutable.

They have some form of marking or animal characteristic, similar to the
Lunars’ Tell, manifesting in any form they take. This is both less obvious and
less magical than a true Tell. It can be hidden under clothing and need not
make one think of animals or Lunars without other reasons to do so, or unless
the player wishes it so. Nonetheless, someone who notices it on the character
in more than one form will be aware that those forms are connected somehow,
even through the confusion of Recumbent Destiny. There is no Illusion hiding
it, but the difficulty to notice it with a (Perception &#x2B; Awareness) roll
is equal to the character’s (Willpower &#x2B; [Essence ÷ 2]).

The Moonlight Lyres may choose to carry silvery tattoos as well. These tattoos
are not really moonsilver and never form the correct patterns to have their
intended effect in any case. A contested (Perception &#x2B; Occult) roll
against the same difficulty as before may find a flaw in the tattoo’s design
revealing it as not quite Lunar and not really moonsilver, if any have cause
to look for it.

For both pseudo-Tell and fake tattoos, the Storyteller may apply bonuses of
&#x2B;1 to &#x2B;5 to observers’ rolls, depending on how familiar they are
with Lunars, how actively they are looking for these signs, and so on. Lastly
note that the forms of these markings are selected when the character joins
the Parametadivision and cannot be changed thereafter.

*Element:* Sweet

*Magical Material:* Moonsilver

*Affinity:* Lunar

*Anima effects:* Common Lunar anima effects, at a cost of 1 mote each:

* Cause her caste mark and tattoos to glow brightly for a scene (as if
the character has spent four to seven motes of Peripheral Essence).
* Cause her anima to glow brightly enough to read by for a scene (as if
the character has spent eight to 10 motes of Peripheral Essence).
* Cause her pseudo-Tell to become unmistakable and impossible to miss
as being (apparently) a Tell.
* Know the precise day of the lunar month, the phase of the moon and the
time of day for the rest of the scene.

By spending 1 mote the character may cause her tattoos (if any) and
pseudo-Tell to completely vanish for one scene.

By spending 10 motes, a Moonlight Lyre can take on the form of any type of
creature she has seen, roughly equivalent in mass to her normal form, for one
scene. She cannot duplicate individual creatures exactly but can, of course,
apply a Disguise action to her new form--if it is sufficiently dexterous or
she has an accomplice to apply the disguise. This is a true transformation, a
Shaping effect rather than an Illusion, but it is a superficial one. She
retains her normal Attribute and Ability ratings, combat statistics and so on,
and close inspection by an expert will reveal that the creature is somehow
unnatural. She can take on the form of a human or other intelligent race but
that grants a bonus of &#x2B;2 to those attempting to spot something unusual,
because clothes, weapons etc. will be joined to and inseparable from the rest
of the body.

Physical abilities based solely on the outward form of the creature,
such as flight, swimming and so on are also limited, though multiplied
by the character’s Essence score; e.g., flight speed will be limited to
(running speed x Essence). Abilities requiring complex internal anatomy,
such as breathing underwater, spinning silk, or spitting venom, are not
granted.

This effect costs 5 motes once his anima banner reaches the 11-15 mote level
and 2 motes at the 16&#x2B; level. The character can re-invoke the power
within a scene to take on a different form.  Lastly, she can also invoke it
reflexively if subject to a Shaping effect, such as Wyld mutation, which would
solely or partly alter her appearance in a way consistent with this power. In
that case, her anima power acts as a perfect defense against the Shaping
effect, but automatically copies the intended shape.

*Associations:* Caprice, inconstancy; parody, mockery; unreliable uncles and
wayward daughters; pragmatism, ruthlessness

*Sobriquets:* The Moonlight Lyres, The Wayward Daughters, Cats among Pigeons,
Motley Dogs

*Concepts:* child raised by wolves, roving Lothario, Wyld barbarian

[[Parameta_Seed_from_Tree,The Division of Seed from Tree]]
==== The Division of Seed from Tree

indexterm:[-, Parametadivisions, Seed from Tree (Dragon-Blooded)]The Princes
of the Earth are the lucky ones flattered by the imitations of this
Parametadivision. Though hostile to all ``anathema'', the Dragon-Blooded are
an influential, wide-spread, mobile host, organized but far from acting in
perfect harmony: often it is easiest to hide a tree in the forest. These
Erisians will work together with their fellows and followers for the good of
some group, as they believe Eris would see it. That said, the group they lead
may not be quite the same as the one they’re trying to help.

*Element:* Boom

*Magical Material:* Jade

*Affinity:* Dragon-Blooded

*Anima effects:* By spending 10 motes, a character may gain some benefits of
his selected element for one scene. Firstly, he may add his Essence in dice to
attempts to resist damage from environmental effects of that element, where
Wood includes plant toxins. Secondly, at Step 10 of attack resolution, he may
subtract 1 from any damage caused by the relevant element, to a minimum of 0,
even if it is not from an environmental source. For example, this applies to
damage from the anima power of a Fire Aspect Dragon-Blooded. Lastly, a
specific power is available corresponding to each element, as a Shaping
effect.

* For Air, leaping distance is multiplied by the his Essence.
* For Earth, his Essence is added to rolls to resist grappling or knockback.
* For Fire, he can ignite flammable materials with a touch.
* For Water, he can breathe water as easily as air, and will not drown.
* For Wood, he can exude a mild plant toxin: living creatures with whom he
makes skin-to-skin contact must make a successful (Stamina &#x2B; Resistance)
roll against the character’s Essence or be affected for the rest of the
scene. The poison causes no damage but imposes a -1 internal penalty due to
nausea. Multiple doses stack their penalties, up to the character’s (Essence ÷
2).

These anima powers activate automatically at the 11-15 mote level of
Peripheral Essence expenditure.  Note that, if the character takes a
miscellaneous action to change to a different element while anima powers are
in use, this will cancel their effect--and doubtless confuse any onlookers.

*Associations:* Empire-building, hidden agendas, wheels within wheels;
insubordination, mutiny, revolution; pretenders, bastards, usurpers

*Sobriquets:* The Knights of The Five-Sided Temple, Fallen Apples, Imitant
Wyrms, The Harvest Ripe and Scattered Seed

*Concepts:* oblivious sybarite, scheming courtier, impassioned
politician, sorcery researcher, apparently-reliable army officer

*Other rules:* Anima flux does not truly apply to those Exalts in this
Parametadivision, though an Illusion of that raw elemental power will
manifest, within a number of feet equal to the character’s permanent
Essence. At the 8-10-mote level it will feel distinctly uncomfortable but will
not cause damage or other adverse effects. At the 11-15-mote level it imposes
1 _die_ of external penalty (i.e., zero or one levels) on each attack or other
action directed at the Exalt, from characters who are unable to soak lethal
damage with Stamina (i.e., excluding Exalts), as they instinctively try to
avoid the (non-existent) damage.  At the 16&#x2B; level it imposes a number of
penalty _dice_ equal to the character’s permanent Essence, which applies to
all characters. This Illusion may be subconsciously resisted for a scene by
spending one Willpower, but observers must spend a further three Willpower to
recognize the Illusion for what it is, and remember it. In that case, the
Illusion will not affect them for the rest of the story. This in itself will
not necessarily cause onlookers to realize that the character is not a
Dragon-Blood, but it may raise their suspicions.

[[Parameta_Might_from_Will,The Division of Might from Will]]
==== The Division of Might from Will

indexterm:[-, Parametadivisions, Might from Will (Sidereal)]To turn what could
be into what is, one needs both direction and action, wisdom and
strength. Erisians who work with this understanding act like the Sidereals,
guiding others along paths by keeping these two threads in harmony, or
diverting them by twisting or breaking one or both.  Commonly they prefer to
pull strings in the background but they are known also to wade into the middle
of things to untangle a mess, or step up to be seen as a sign and guiding
light to others.

*Element:* Pungent

*Magical Material:* Starmetal

*Affinity:* Sidereal

*Anima effects:* Common Sidereal anima effects, at a cost of 1 mote
each:

* Make her caste mark obvious for one minute, as if the character had
spent 8-10 motes of Peripheral Essence.
* Know the exact time and date by sensing the position of celestial
bodies--or other significant bodies, meaning this ability works in realms
such as Malfeas or (insofar as time has meaning there) the Wyld.
* Attune her anima to the ripples cast by doorways between worlds. For
the rest of the scene, the character recognizes the presence of gateways
to Heaven, Malfeas, the Underworld, the Wyld, Autochthonia, Elsewhere or
any other alternative reality, within (Essence x 100) feet. She does not
learn the gateway’s precise location, only that it is present.

*[TODO: Is the following a bit meh?  It's not that great outside Creation or
away from Sidereals.  Should there be some extra benefit to being inside Fate?
Should there also be something about switching between being or not being
Creatures of Darkness?]*

By spending 10 motes, one of the Foolish Sages gains the ability to step fully
into or out of Fate, for one scene. The character may change his status any
number of times within the scene, but each change requires a miscellaneous
action. Alternatively the character can pay a further 2 motes on a given
action to make it reflexive, and may do so automatically whenever a Fate-based
effect could target him. Stepping outside Fate grants immunity to any Charms
with the Fate keyword, to the crafting or transferring of crafted destinies,
and to being located via the Loom of Fate. It will not remove a destiny or
Fate-based effect which has already been applied, unless the description of
that effect states that it works in that way. Stepping fully into Fate, the
Exalt allows Fate-based effects to occur as normal. The confusion of identity
that the Recumbent Destiny causes is not removed, as it is not a Fate-based
effect. A Foolish Sage who enters Autochthonia will soon realize that he can
step into or out of the Design of Autochthon as well. He cannot be within the
Design and the Loom simultaneously, however. This effect costs 5 motes once
her anima banner reaches the 11-15 mote level and 2 motes at the 16&#x2B;
level.

==== The Division of Blood from Stone

indexterm:[-, Parametadivisions, Blood from Stone (Alchemical)]Just as the
Maker’s Chosen are constructed in the image of mortals, to give them a face
which is not too foreign to the populace, so Erisians of this Parametadivision
don a new skin to walk un­challenged among those alien cultures. They are
aware that, particularly in Autochthonia, they are a piece in a large machine;
but they also know that every living cog has its own will and destiny.

Members of the Seventh Column must choose a particular Alchemical type
to mimic initially, but can change that later.

*Element:* Prickle

*Magical Material:* Any of orichalcum, moon­silver, jade, starmetal,
soulsteel, and adamant.

*Affinity:* Alchemical

*Anima effects:*

Common Alchemical anima effects, at a cost of 1 mote each:

* Cause her anima banner to flare up to any desired level of display for
the rest of the scene.

The character may take a miscellaneous action to change small details of
her appearance, to mimic the installation of different Charms. In this
case she remains recognizably the same and this is not suspicious to
Autochthonian natives. Alternatively the character may adopt the
appearance of an Apostate with Voidtech Charms, with the expected
effects on her encounters. This does not itself change her material
alignment.

If the character changes material while anima powers are in use, this will
cancel their effect--and doubtless confuse any onlookers.  If changing
alignment means that it no longer matches some artifacts which a character has
already attuned, the attunement is unaffected, but he will no longer gain
material-specific bonuses when wielding it, unless and until his anima powers
are activated.

By spending 10 motes reflexively, one of the Greys can gain access to the
material-specific bonuses of all his attuned artifacts, regardless of his own
current alignment, at no additional attunement cost and without the need for a
(Wits &#x2B; Lore) roll. In the case of weapons and armor made from the
magical materials, the character may optionally replace the bonuses of any
item with those for the material with which he is currently aligned. This
applies even to artifacts tainted with Vitriol.

If the character is not wielding a weapon made from the magical
materials--either because his weapon is made of something else, or because he
wields no weapon--he nonetheless gains the attack bonuses of his own
material. Defense bonuses are applied similarly to characters not wearing
armor made of the magical materials. This effect lasts for one scene, and
applies automatically once her anima banner reaches the 8-10 mote level.

*Associations:* Faith, dogma, tools; hierarchy, society, service, the
greater good; free will, conflicting loyalties, conflicted madness

*Sobriquets:* Bishops of Greyface, Greys, Loose Cogs, The Seventh
Column

*Concepts:* re-interpreter of dogma, conciliatory Apostate,
trans-national ambassador, covert visitor from Creation, fervent
nationalist

*Other rules:* The cosmetic effects of the Bishops’ Exalted Affinity
extend to them leaving chemical trails as anima levels rise. However,
this is only an Illusion and will gradually fade, vanishing by the end
of the scene. The usual rules for resisting Illusions apply, though
onlookers will generally not do so unless they are specifically looking
for Illusions or have a reason to suspect the Erisian is not the
Alchemical she appears to be.

Erisians in this Parametadivision cannot be re-fitted or repaired in
Alchemical vats and will not increase in size as their Essence rises,
though their bearing may become more imposing. To some Alchemicals, this
may be enough to give away their foreign nature.

[[Parameta_Divison_by_Zero,The Division by Zero]]
==== The Division by Zero

indexterm:[-, Parametadivisions, Division by Zero (Abyssal)]Discordians are
drawn to this Parametadivision if they choose to devote themselves to opposing
the Neverborn, the Abyssals, and their mundane and magical allies. The paths
of Erisian Chaos may be about tearing things down, but more to set them free
than not to destroy them. Death is part of life, but Chaos is never Oblivion,
for that is the end of possibility.

Given the obvious dangers, they are most likely to do their work from
within: wreaking destruction where it will lead to some good; bringing
people to an understanding of endings which avoids despair; freeing
ghosts from the attachments that hold them back from Lethe; sabotaging
Deathlord plans by being too blatant in their actions. At times they
pretend Resonance by using the balance effects of Numerology to cause
damage but leave reparation in their wake.

*Element:* Dirt

*Magical Material:* Soulsteel

*Affinity:* Abyssal

*Anima effects:* Common Abyssal anima effects, at a cost of 1 mote each:

* Cause their anima to flare to any level of display up to the 8–10 mote
level. This display lasts for a scene or until reflexively dismissed,
after which the character’s anima dims to its actual level.
* Attune her Essence to the emanations of the Underworld for a scene,
extending this sixth sense to a radius of (Essence x 100) yards.

By default these Exalted respire normal Essence, except when they change their
essence signature to that of an Abyssal, in which case they respire
death-aspected Essence. By spending 1 mote, a character can switch between
respiring normal and death-aspected Essence, independently of his current
Essence signature.  He can switch any number of times in a day but will revert
to his natural state at the next sunset or sunrise (or equivalent time in the
Underworld or other realm), or when he changes his Essence signature.

By spending 10 motes, a Finger of the Left Hand can reanimate a corpse as a
zombie extra, or take control of a single existing zombie (or equivalent)
within a 10-yard range. Both newly-animated and existing zombies affected by
this power decay rapidly, suffering one aggravated level of damage per day
until they disintegrate. If another being actively controls an existing
zombie, it must make a contested (Essence &#x2B; Willpower) roll against the
character to retain control.

Alternatively the character may reflexively spend 10 motes to take control of
a being which has taken sufficient damage to take it into or past its Dying
health levels. This stabilizes the target at its current level (or its last
Dying health level, if it would have died outright) and heals one level of
lethal damage every 6 ticks, until the being reaches Incapacitated. At the
same time, the being becomes able to move around and act physically as normal,
under the character’s direction as a Total Control effect. The target cannot
interact socially while it remains unconscious, but its wound penalties are
reduced to -2. If the target is healed above Incapacitated, the control ends
immediately. If the target is still Incapacitated at the end of the scene, the
control ends and the being returns to unconsciousness.

Either or both of these powers may be activated at no cost once per action,
when the character has spent at least 11-15 motes of Peripheral Essence.

over-eagerness, excess; rejection, abandonment

[[Parameta_Sub-Divison,The Sub-Division]]
==== The Sub-Division

indexterm:[-, Parametadivisions, Sub-Division (Infernal)]The Chosen of Eris
who seek to wrestle with the philosophy of dominance and oppression may join
this Parametadivision, and are as likely to aid the schemes of the Yozi as to
oppose them. What Discordian could but love the free will which the
Primordials gave to mortals, or but sorrow at how the will of the Yozi is now
bound. The struggle to bring any sort of balance between the prisoners and
their jailers is an epic one worthy of a Discordian.

One who takes this path may choose to gain some vaguely demonic twists
to her form, though these will be cosmetic rather than functional, and
need not resemble any one demon. The details of these deviations can be
changed later, to some extent.

*Element:* Binding

*Magical Material:* Any magical material tainted with Vitriol

*Affinity:* Infernals

*Anima effects:* Common Infernal anima effects, costing one mote each:

* Cause his caste mark to glow brightly for a scene (as if the character
has spent 4-7 motes of Peripheral Essence).
* Cause his caste mark to clearly illuminate everything within a 10 yard
radius for a scene (as if the character has spent 4-7 motes of
Peripheral Essence).
* Sense the nearest entry point into the Yozi realm or the nearest
pathway that leads to the desert of Cecelyne.

As well as the normal Parametadivisional use of a miscellaneous action
to change her apparent caste, the character may do so to change some
cosmetic aspect of her appearance, to mimic demonic mutations or the
effects of Charms such as Viridian Legend Exoskeleton. This change of
appearance is purely cosmetic, offering no benefits beyond persuading
others of her alleged Infernal nature, and does not obscure the
character’s identity.

*[TODO: Pick one of the following alternatives.]*

By spending 10 motes, one of the Inmates may trade burdens with one who
is bound by a magically enforced oath.  The Discordian character gains the
requirements and penalties of the target’s oath, and the target takes on a new
oath, agreed with and sworn to the character, with the same penalties as the
original. An oath can only be traded in this fashion if the being which
originally enforced it had a lower Essence than the Exalt herself.  This
effect requires the two to shake hands (or otherwise touch) and the target
must be willing.  Each character must also be a valid target for the new oath.
For instance, even the mightiest Discordian could not use this power to shift
the oaths binding the Yozi, as they are too specific to each one of those
great beings.

Alternatively, the character may exchange existing oaths applying to any two
willing beings.  Both the conditions and penalties of the oaths are swapped.
As in the previous case, each target's oath must be applicable to the other,
and the effects enforcing each oath must have been applied by a being with an
Essence less than the character's.

In either case, the exchange persists indefinitely until this power is
re-activated to restore willing targets to their original state, or the
character dies.

This power applies not only to oaths sanctified by Eclipse-caste Solars, but
also to those enforced by certain Dragon-Blooded Charms, to Fair Folk oaths,
and so on.  Exchanging a Fair Folk adjuration requires the recipient to commit
the necessary motes.  Other types of magical enforcement may involve other
complications.

*[TODO: Hmm ... this also reads like it could be a follow-on to one of my
Bureaucracy Charms, but I have loads of those already.]*

*[TODO: Or maybe, provide general bonuses to freeing things--from physical
bindings, mental influence, Malfean imprisonment (i.e., demon summoning),
Intimacies etc.--and penalties to binding things? This could interact with
oaths for the scene, e.g., providing bonuses to break them, or forcing a
contested roll to allow the botch to happen, or ...]*

By spending 10 motes, the character is able to support any actions to bend or
break bindings of any sort.  For the rest of the scene, once each action she
may reflexively apply one of the following effects to a single target within
(Essence x 5) yards.  She may target herself with these powers.

* Reduce the Willpower cost to resist mental influence by one point, to a
minimum of zero points.  The character will know intuitively if anyone in
range is being subjected to mental influence, natural or otherwise, and may
respond immediately.

* Add (Essence ÷ 2) dice to an action attempting to break a binding of any
sort, be it physical, social, emotional, mental or otherwise.  A connection
which could be voluntary released, or is wholly positive, does not constitute
a binding--exatly what does is up to the Storyteller.

* Cancel the penalties which would apply from an action which violates a
magically-enforced oath binding the target.  The oath is simply regarded as
not having been broken in that action.

* Reduce a target's effective Echoes, Past Life, Pineal Gland, Solar Bond or
Whispers rating by the character's Essence, to a minimum of zero, for one
action.  The character will know intuitively if anyone in range is attempting
to use these Backgrounds, and may respond immediately.

*[TODO: And/Or ... By spending 10??? motes, a follower of The True Religion
can choose to whether or not to be affected as a Creature of Darkness for one
scene, regardless of their current anima.]*

[[Parameta_Division_of_Labor,The Division of Labor]]
==== The Division of Labor

indexterm:[-, Parametadivisions, Division of Labor (Jadeborn)]To Eris'
Children the Mountain Folk are long overdue an injection of Chaos, and
therefore some choose to walk among them.  They were trapped in Creation, then
neglected, exploited, bound, and lastly abandoned by Autochthon.  A hero among
them created the caste system to stave off decline, but they need another
change.  That they have access to some of the best manufacturing and weapons
facilities in Creation, back doors into the Blessed Isle, and raksha souls,
are happy coincidences.

Simply making off with handy artifacts is an option, but unlikely to be
entertaining enough by itself.  Discordians who spend time under Meru may try
to stir up Jadeborn society by posing as heroes, opposing existing heroes to
emphasize their cause, or help or hinder the Darkbrood as suits them.
Influencing Dragon-Blooded society directly would be difficult, but gaining
vital information or interfering with the equipment for their plans are quite
possible.

An Uprising Pillar must choose a Jadeborn Caste to mimic when he takes on this
Parametadivision, but may change that at any time with a miscellaneous
action.  The choice of Caste has no effect on his powers, but will naturally
affect his interactions with others.

*Element:* Focus

*Magical Material:* Jade

*Affinity:* Mountain Folk (Jadeborn)

*Anima effects:* Jadeborn do not have animas nor, therefore, anima
powers. The Erisians of this Parametadivision do, however, and are
unable to truly suppress their anima unless other effects are employed.
If they attempt to make their normal anima appear as a ``Jadeborn anima'',
it will manifest as follows.

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|====
|Motes of Peripheral Essence |Effects
|1-3|
The Jadeborn aspects of their appearance are enhanced,
making them more striking.
|4-7|
Jadeborn rocky skin and crystalline or metallic highlights become
unusually pronounced and have a slight glow, to a level which may be
noticed by observant onlookers (roll [Perception &#x2B; Awareness] at
standard difficulty).
|8-10|
Jadeborn skin characteristics are strongly enhanced, giving a &#x2B;1
bonus to Appearance for any effects relating to Jadeborn of the same
Caste. A crystalline mark on the character’s forehead becomes very
pronounced and has a definite glow, noticeable by anyone paying
attention. Stealth Charms are usable but mundane Stealth attempts suffer
a &#x2B;1 difficulty.
|11-15|
The character appears to be made from rock, and glitters gently
all over. The Appearance bonus applies to all Jadeborn Castes. Stealth
Charms fail and mundane Stealth attempts suffer a &#x2B;2 difficulty.
|16&#x2B;|
The character appears to be made from unnaturally pure rock and
glows brightly enough to be visible for up to a mile. The Appearance
bonus applies in relation to all other characters and any other effects.
Stealth is impossible.
|====

Their anima grants the following powers.

* Jade Sense (<<SoFR>>, p. 39): spending 1 mote reflexively allows the Exalt
to detect the existence of jade within (Essence x 5) yards; a further mote
gives the direction; and a third tells whether it contains the soul of a
Jadeborn.  This ability is active automatically at the 4-7 mote level.
Additionally, while this power is active in Creation (or the Underworld), the
character can feel the direction in which the Elemental Pole of Earth (or the
Mouth of Oblivion) lies.

By spending 10 motes, the character may take advantage of her affinity with
the slavery of the Jadeborn race.  For the rest of the scene she may choose to
avoid gaining either Hodge or Podge for respectively applying or resisting
unnatural mental influence, provided the cost to resist is no more than her
(Essence ÷ 3).  However, her effective Pineal Gland rating is likewise reduced
by (Essence ÷ 3).  The cost to activate this power is reduced to 5 motes at
the 8-10 level, 2 at the 11-15 level, and it may be activated at no cost when
her anima reaches its totemic level.

[[Parameta_Indivisibles,The Indivisibles]]
==== The Indivisibles

indexterm:[-, Parametadivisions, Indivisibles (Raksha)]Some Fair Folk Courts
are undoubtedly aware of the Discordians, and agitated to find that these
Chosen do not pantomime only the others of their kind from within Creation,
but also the natives of the Wyld. For their part, the Chosen of Eris may
venture into the shifting Marches to bring some Chaos back to Creation, or
perhaps to tip the balance of power and force some order on the place.

Raksha who enter Creation take on a fixed form for their sojourn there, and
likewise Discordians entering this Parametadivision must choose one form,
roughly equivalent in mass to their original self. They may change this form
arbitrarily each time they cross between the Wyld (Middlemarches or deeper)
and any other realm (Creation, the Underworld etc.). The form offers no
enhancements to their Attributes or Abilities, nor any other mechanical
advantages, but although the act of change is a Shaping effect, the resulting
form is not: it becomes the character’s natural form. If the character leaves
this Parametadivision through Divisional Realignment, she returns to her
original form, and any Shaping effects active upon her are removed.

An Exalt entering the ranks of the Indivisibles also gains latent Graces
and shaping damage tracks corresponding to the values of her Virtues, at
the time she enters the Parametadivision. Her Heart Grace is rated at
(Essence ÷ 2), with a minimum of 2. Raksha can observe and interact with
these Graces as normal. However, except when she uses her anima power to
activate them, she cannot access them for shaping combat and the like,
nor can others use them to influence her. One of the Fair Folk may take
ownership of one of the character’s Graces but, as long as it remains
latent, it grants no hold over the character. The character can spend
experience to raise the values of these Graces as if she were a raksha
commoner. If she leaves this Parameta­division, all such experience is
refunded. If the character acquires Graces through other means, these
are not latent and are tracked separately. When her latent Graces are
active, add the two ratings, to a maximum of 5.

These Erisians can attune Wyld artifacts and acquire gossamer to power
oneiromantic spells and raksha treasures. They are capable of learning Craft
(Glamour) but cannot apply it without access to suitable Charms--borrowed from
raksha with Charm-Filching Prana, perhaps, or developed personally. They are
also capable of gaining the Gossamer Background but it does not grant
Assumption Charms and, unless they have a way of forging gossamer, neither
does it translate into enhanced Resources in Creation.

*Element:* Dream

*Magical Material:* Gossamer

*Affinity:* Fair Folk

*Anima Effects:* As with the Jadeborn, the raksha have no anima, but the
power of the Discordians who mimic them must vent itself. If they
attempt to make their normal anima appear as a ``Fair Folk anima'', it
will manifest in ways which are equivalently noticeable but as
increasingly dramatic enhancements to their chosen appearance. The
changes may not include a glow but will have some other area effect
noticeable from a distance, e.g., an irritating noise of insects, a
blowing of rainbow snow or similar.

In the Wyld or in uncapped demenses, an Erisian in this Parametadivision may
spend 10 motes to access her latent Graces for one scene. This enables her to
take shaping actions and make shaping attacks. It also means that she does not
restrict the flow of time for raksha as Creation-born normally do. This anima
effect is accessible for no cost once the character’s anima reaches the 11-15
mote level. If the character re-activates this power in the immediately
following scene, it costs only 5 motes. The character does not have feeding
Graces; her dice pool for Join Shaping Battle is the sum of her two highest
Graces. If this power is not active, the character suffers the results of
successful shaping attacks as any other Creation-born (see <<GWM>>, p. 126).
If the character enters some other area or realm where Shaping actions are
possible, she may also activate this power there.

Where Shaping actions are not possible, her anima power instead enables her to
feed on others’ Virtues, in a manner more benign than the raksha’s.  Any time
a being within (Essence x 10) yards channels or suppresses a Virtue, the
character can either regain a single channel of the same Virtue, or heal a
single level of damage to the corresponding shaping damage track. This effect
costs 10 motes to activate for a scene, and activates automatically once the
character’s anima reaches the 11-15 mote level. There is no reduced cost to
activating it in subsequent scenes, however.

[[Divisional_Realignment]]
=== Divisional Realignment

indexterm:[-,Divisional Realignment]
indexterm:[-,Divisions,Realignment]At character creation time the player makes
a choice of Division and, usually, Parametadivision. While the former is
fixed, the latter need not be. If a cabal of five or more Erisians from
different Divisions meet during Calibration, they may join in the day-long
rite of Divisional Realignment, at a cost of 8xp. Certain artifacts, manses or
other sources of power might allow the rite to take place at other times or
with fewer participants, perhaps at greater cost. This allows them each to
move to a different Parametadivision. Each Exalt must change, and all must end
up in a different Parametadivision from where they started.  This is not a
simple exchange: some may end up in a Parametadivision different from any the
participants originally had.  However, none may return to the state, optional
at character creation, of having no Parametadivision.

To aid in impersonating their newly-chosen power group, and as a function of
the way in which unique viewpoints of the Children of Eris shape their world,
each can go further and rebuild his or her Charm trees to a limited
extent. Charms belonging to the Divisional or Favored Abilities selected at
character generation cannot be exchanged, nor can those belonging to Martial
Arts styles. However, Discordian Martial Arts Charms which do not belong to
any style, or which are character-specific extensions to a style, can be
exchanged--unless Martial Arts is a Divisional or Favored Ability.  Up to
(Essence x 3) Charms from other Abilities may be un-learned and instantly
replaced with other Charms from any Ability, or from any Martial Arts style of
which the character already knows at least one Charm. Normal prerequisite
constraints apply: the character cannot un-learn a Charm but keep Charms which
have it as a prerequisite, nor learn new Charms without first learning their
prerequisites. For Charms which may be purchased multiple times, a character
must unlearn or learn each purchase separately.  Discordians cannot normally
learn Charms from other types of magical beings but, should a Child find a
way, they will be unable to exchange such Charms during Divisional
Realignment.

This Charm exchange is also available to a lesser extent as an extension of
the self-development which occurs when an Erisian raises his Essence.  When a
player has spent the necessary experience to do this, and the character the
necessary time, up to (Essence) Charms may be exchanged at that time,
following the above constraints.

[[Hodge_and_Podge,Hodge and Podge]]
=== The Not-So-Great Curse

indexterm:[-,Great Curse]
indexterm:[-,Hodge and Podge]
indexterm:[-,Hodge,and Podge]
indexterm:[-,Podge,Hodge and]It may be because the Discordian Exalted were
created long after the Primordial War, or successfully hid any involvement
they had, or because their matron really is a Primordial, but somehow they
have avoided the effects of the Great Curse. However, their Exaltations have
been constructed imperfectly (or made to be perfectly imperfect?), so they
don’t get off entirely lightly. Rather than Limit, these Exalted accrue points
in two separate measures, Hodge and Podge. When a character spends Willpower
to channel her primary Virtue, or when she applies unnatural mental influence
to a target and that target successfully resists, she gains a point of
Hodge--overriding the will and actions of the individual, their inherent
chaos, is just wrong, y’see. When she spends Willpower to act against her
primary Virtue or resist unnatural mental influence, she gains a point of
Podge--resisting the your own urges and the will of others suppresses disorder
in another way. In either case she can gain no more than one point of each per
scene.

When the count of Hodge reaches 10 (or more), the character is driven to
oppose the tenets, tendencies and desires of the dominant order, as she
understands them. The dominant order is determined as follows. If there
is a single character present in the scene with a higher Essence than
all others (including the Discordian), their beliefs are taken on.
Beings which the character cannot perceive are ignored for this effect.
The character need not know the precise beliefs of the individual; she
might take on ``the typical beliefs of a Solar'', for example, if she
believes the dominant character to be a Solar. If no suitable individual
exists, take the perceived most dominant social structure or formal
organization of the town, kingdom or similar large grouping in which the
Exalt finds herself. Failing that, _i.e._, if no one society is
dominant, or there is no social grouping nearby, take the inherent
tendencies of the nearest major environmental force, be it an elemental
pole of Creation, the Wyld, or somewhere on the other side of a magical
portal.

When the count of Podge reaches 10 (or more), the character is driven to
act strictly in accordance with the dominant order, again insofar as she
understands it. If both reach or pass 10, the character must support the
dominant order and oppose the next most dominant, or the other way
round--her choice. If the dominant order is an environmental one, the
next most dominant will be the next-nearest environmental one. This
effect lasts one scene, after which both counts reset to zero.

[[Profane_Fate]]
=== Profane Fate

indexterm:[-,Profane Fate]
indexterm:[-,Recumbent Destiny]
indexterm:[-,Destiny,Recumbent]The confusion which comes with the Discordian
Exaltation extends to their very existence in reality. They are not able to
wear different destinies as are the Sidereals but have a single Recumbent
Destiny, which enables them to lie low whenever they wish, which is most of
the time. This nature goes beyond the Sidereals’ Fate-twisting presence--it is
not a ``Destiny'' in the sense the bureaucracies of Yu-Shan would use, so it
functions in every realm of Reality, not only among the strands of Creation’s
Loom of Fate. This magic is a Shaping effect operating on memories and similar
physical records, so specifically targeted Shaping defenses may partly or
fully ward against it.

Unlike the Sidereal’s broken-Mask ``blessing'', a Discordian chooses when to
activate her Recumbent Destiny, and does so retroactively. Spending a point of
temporary Willpower activates this effect, targeting a number of beings who
have observed her up to a Magnitude equal to her Essence, covering any single
scene in the last day (or equivalent time periods in the Wyld and other
realms). The character can spend further points of temporary Willpower to
increase the Magnitude, and to increase the time from which the effect should
start and the retrospective duration as follows. No more than 5 points can be
spent on each, and it is not possible to choose a duration longer than the
onset time, since this power can only alter memories, not future events.

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|====
|Willpower Points |Maximum onset time
|0 |One day ago
|1 |One week ago
|2 |One month ago
|3 |One season ago
|4 |One year ago
|5 |One decade ago
|====

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|====
|Willpower Points |Maximum duration
|0 |One scene or hour
|1 |One day
|2 |One week
|3 |One month
|4 |One season
|5 |One year
|====

The targets must have been observing the character during the selected time
period, though she need not have been aware of their observation for the
effect to apply to them. Thereafter, whenever an affected target wishes to
recall the character--her presence, appearance, actions and so on--he must
roll (Wits &#x2B; Integrity) at a difficulty 1 but with an internal penalty of
-3, or -(Discordian’s Essence) if greater. A target who is himself a
Discordian gains his Essence in bonus dice, however. The target rolls each
time he attempts to remember until he has made (Discordian’s Essence)
successful rolls. Failure on any roll means the target has forgotten the
details of his observations and makes no further rolls. Similarly, gaining
more successes than the Discordian’s Essence in a single roll means the target
has clearly remembered the details, and need make no more rolls to retain his
memories.

Failure to remember does not mean a complete blank in experience, rather
the target will remember some of what happened but with the details
confused--they will be sure that the person’s gender was opposite, or
that there was in fact a group of five or six acting in concert, or that
events which happened in one scene were spread out over several days, or
that they were Lunar rather than Solar. The specifics are up to the
Storyteller but the effect is to make it harder to connect the memories
with reality, making them less likely to connect the Exalt with them,
should they meet again. In a group of witnesses there may be several
distinct groups of slightly different memories, or each person may have
his own recollection.

Certain Backgrounds allow the character to selectively exclude
individuals from a target group. She may also always choose to exclude
specific Essence-users with whom she is acquainted, meaning those with
whom she has interacted for at least a few scenes.

Physical records of the character’s interactions are also subtly tweaked
by this effect. Attempts to track down accurate information about her
using such skills as Bureaucracy, Investigation, and Survival, for
example, have their difficulty increased by (Discordian’s Essence ÷ 2).
Rolls which would have succeeded but for the increased difficulty turn
up misleading or confused information, as per the effect on memories.
Failed rolls simply indicate a normal failure.

Only the memories of the original observers are directly affected so, if
a Discordian waits too long to erase her tracks, hearsay and rumor may
contain some record of her. However, discerning the truth through such
reports is subject to the same increased difficulty as for physical
records.

As well as provoking confusion in witnesses and records, the Recumbent
Destiny offers some protection from the machinations of Yu-Shan. If
someone attempts to locate the character by inspecting the Loom of Fate
within a week of her activating her Recumbent Destiny, she is always
treated as having Essence 1 and, after applying any other modifiers, the
difficulty is multiplied by her (Essence ÷ 2). Furthermore, if the
seeker botches only after accumulating enough successes that he would
have found the character but for this extra multiplier then, rather than
fail to find the character at all, he will incorrectly identify a
different strand as belonging to the character.

[[Backgrounds]]
=== Backgrounds

indexterm:[-,Backgrounds]Given that Discordians often pose as other kinds of
powerful beings, they can in principle have access to almost any Background.
Specific notes about certain Backgrounds appear below, but the details of how
these and others actually function in your game must be discussed with your
Storyteller.

==== Standard Backgrounds

All of the standard Backgrounds apply to Discordian Exalted, but most
are altered in some way.

[[Background_Allies,Allies]]
===== Allies

indexterm:[-,Backgrounds,Allies]Similarly to the Sidereals, the Erisians tend
to find it difficult to gain true allies; not because they are mystically
difficult to remember, but because they prefer to keep their existence and
goals quiet.  However, they may align themselves, often temporarily and under
false identities, with those who wish to upset the prevailing ways: raksha on
the borders of Creation, Lunars in the Wyld, rebel slaves in Guild
encampments, Dynasts in the River Province, and so on. In mechanical terms, at
the end of a story (or at any other significant juncture the Storyteller deems
appropriate), Erisians may give up any one or more allies of their choice and
re-spend those dots on new allies. Former allies do not simply disappear,
however (well, except for some of the raksha), and may or may not remain
friendly.

To be recognized by allies, the Exalt’s Recumbent Destiny must be
suppressed. This succeeds automatically for those who have made this sort of
bond but, as ever, any witnesses will also recognize the character.

[[Background_Artifact,Artifact]]
===== Artifact

indexterm:[-,Backgrounds,Artifact]Given the obscurity in which they have so
far labored, Discordian Exalted have found it harder to come by artifacts of
power, and very difficult to obtain the most powerful without drawing unwanted
attention. The normal rules for Solars apply, with an additional cost at
character creation time: Artifact 4 items cost 5 dots, and Artifact 5 costing
7. Artifacts gained or created during play have the usual experience cost but,
as ever, the most powerful are likely to draw high-powered attention.

[[Background_Backing,Backing]]
===== Backing

indexterm:[-,Backgrounds,Backing]Again due to the need to remain hidden,
starting Erisian characters cannot have a Backing rating of more than 3 in any
one organization ...  unless that organization itself is unknown to most
people, either because it is secret (e.g., the Grass Spiders, the Salinan
Society) or because it is based far from any other civilization.

Interacting with a backing organization requires a temporary lifting of
Recumbent Destiny, with the usual implications for being generally
recognized. The normal difficulty is reduced by the effective Backing
rating of the highest-ranking other member of the organization present,
to a minimum of zero.

[[Background_Contacts,Contacts]]
===== Contacts

indexterm:[-,Backgrounds,Contacts]Given their propensity for playing off
different groups against each other, the Priests of Eris fare better than
average in regard to this Background. Buying dots beyond 3 still only costs 1
bonus point per dot.  Additionally, when rolling to find a minor contact, they
may add dice from any relevant Ability (e.g., Socialize, Bureaucracy,
Presence), including use of Excellencies.

To deal with a contact, the Exalt’s Recumbent Destiny must be suppressed. This
succeeds auto­matically in the presence of major contacts, but requires a
(Wits &#x2B; Occult) roll for minor ones. While this obfuscation is lifted,
onlookers will also recognize the character.

[[Background_Cult,Cult]]
===== Cult

indexterm:[-,Backgrounds,Cult]Members of the Discordian Society are strongly
discouraged from having cults themselves--it being a non-prophet
organization--but they may gain the benefits of this Background insofar as
they bring others to devoutly follow some ideal which furthers a disbalancing
of order and chaos appropriate to the situation. If significant numbers of
cult members start to worship the Exalt directly, the effect of the Background
is as if it were one dot lower, until they are dissuaded. No starting
character may have the Cult Background above 3.

To be recognized by cult members, the Exalt’s Recumbent Destiny must be
suppressed. In the presence of cult members this will succeed
auto­matically but means that, as usual, onlookers will recognize the
character, too.

[[Background_Familiar,Familiar]]
===== Familiar

indexterm:[-,Backgrounds,Familiar]This Background applies as normal to the
Children of Eris. Familiars always recognize the character, regardless of
whether or not the Recumbent Destiny is in effect.

[[Background_Followers,Followers]]
===== Followers

indexterm:[-,Backgrounds,Followers]Discordians seem to be better at founding
Cults--or encouraging others to found their own, just for kicks--than
attracting direct followers. This Background provides a fifth of the number of
followers that a Solar Exalt would attract for the same number of
dots. However, it also requires one less dot in Resources, Backing or
Influence to support them. Hence a single dot in Followers provides a single
loyal sidekick who is willing and able to pay his or her own way.

Trait Effects: +
|====
|• |Provides a single follower.
|•• |Provides up to 5 followers.
|••• |Provides 20 followers.
|•••• |Provides a loyal band of 100 followers.
|••••• |Provides a small army of 1,000 followers.
|====

The Exalt can choose a group of up to 5 core followers who will
recognize him or her without the need for the Recumbent Destiny to be
suppressed. Beyond that, lifting the obscuration succeeds auto­matically
for followers, but has the usual implication that any onlookers will
also see him or her directly.

[[Background_Influence,Influence]]
===== Influence

indexterm:[-,Backgrounds,Influence]Discordians are able to gain influence in
society as well as Solar Exalts, though they usually prefer to do so only with
some magical disguise in effect, since they must lift their Recumbent Destiny
in order to gain fame and exercise their influence, and this lifting is not
automatic.

[[Background_Manse,Manse]]
===== Manse

indexterm:[-,Backgrounds,Manse]The Manse Background functions normally for the
Children of Eris. Their tricksome nature some­how includes the peculiar
ability of being able to disentangle themselves from an attunement to a
demesne, unlike other Essence users (<<Exalted>>, p. 27).  Hence they are more
willing to take advantage of these naturally occurring power sources, and
indeed revel in their unpredictability.

[[Background_Mentor,Mentor]]
===== Mentor

indexterm:[-,Backgrounds,Mentor]This Background applies as normal to the
Discordians. Mentors may or may not know the character’s true nature but, in
any case, the bond of mentorship allows the character to automatically lift
the Recumbent Destiny in the presence of the mentor. As usual, onlookers will
also be unaffected while it is lifted.

[[Background_Resources,Resources]]
===== Resources

indexterm:[-,Backgrounds,Resources]This Background functions normally for
Dis­cordian Exalts. They prefer sources of income which are hard to track back
to them, but that is a matter of flavor rather than mechanics.

[[Background_Sifu,Sifu]]
===== Sifu

indexterm:[-,Backgrounds,Sifu]Discordians can learn Sidereal martial arts, and
can having a rating in this Background. However, a starting character cannot
have a sifu rated above three, and had better have a good reason why a
Sidereal is actually willing to teach her. The Sidereal may be a ronin, and
undoubtedly has his own reasons, too.

[[Background_Spies,Spies]]
===== Spies

indexterm:[-,Backgrounds,Spies]The Spies Background available to Discordians
is equivalent in effect to that which Abyssal Exalted have. However, in this
case, the agents in question are not necessarily part of one network serving a
single master, and usually do not know who the character works for--even
assuming the character knows that. Rather, this Background enables a Priestess
of Eris to use certain passwords and signs to gain information from spies in
networks set up by other powers. She gains no special influence over these
organizations but equally she is unlikely to be treated with suspicion, unless
she does something clearly opposed to an organization, and cannot come up with
a convincing subtle reason why. If a character truly does fall out of favor
with a spy network in some area, the Storyteller may allow her to transfer
dots of this Background to some other area with a little work, and perhaps a
reduced experience cost.

==== Extra Backgrounds

[[Background_Pineal_Gland,Pineal Gland]]
===== Pineal Gland

indexterm:[-,Backgrounds,Pineal Gland]This Background represents the
character’s intuitive connection to Eris herself, through mystical enhancement
of an organ placed just above the eyes in the anatomy of all human beings (and
somewhere nearby in other mortal races, as it happens). As well as
contributing to the efficacy of Numerology actions, this Background represents
the number of times in a story that the character may channel the spirit of
Eris for aid. Rather than adding dice to a roll, it enables the character to
get a hint from Eris (i.e., gets the player a hint from the Storyteller) as to
the best action to take, in the immediate circumstances, to support his or her
Motivation. This advice may be cryptic, short-sighted, or otherwise a mixed
blessing, but it will be at least slightly helpful. The Storyteller rolls the
character’s (Wits &#x2B; Pineal Gland) and the number of successes determines
the usefulness of the result, with a botch resulting in some actively
misleading information. Accessing the pineal gland in this manner is a
miscellaneous action. Using up ``channels'' of this Background during a story
does not reduce its value in Numerology actions.

[[Background_Echoes,Echoes]]
===== Echoes

indexterm:[-,Backgrounds,Echoes]Discordian Exaltations do not get recycled
through Lytek’s cabinet and research so far points to few, if any, of them
being around during the First Age. The experience of Erisian Exaltation does
not include a flood of memories of the past, so it’s not even certain that the
Exaltations persist between multiple hosts. This lack of connection to the
past can put Discordians at some disadvantage compared to other types of
Exalts, and cause problems when trying to pass as one of them. Eris is skilled
in appropriating others’ ideas, however, and has given her Children a way to
tap into ancient wisdom (or ancient foolishness, as the case may be).

Each point in this Background allows the character to access fragments
of the memories of a single now-deceased Exalt of any type, including
another Discordian, or any kind of being for which a Parametadivision
exists. The memories will cover only a single lifetime and may or may
not match those memories which, for instance, Lytek would have chosen.
The player must choose the identity and lifetime of the Echoed character
when the Background is purchased, and record suitable Motivation and
Intimacies. It cannot be purchased more than once for a given past life.

By spending a point of Willpower reflexively, the character can adjust
his Essence signature to precisely match that of the echoed Exaltation
for a single scene, provided his current apparent anima and Essence type
matches. This faking of identity might allow the character to, for
instance, activate an individually-keyed First Age artifact, or pass as
a particular Sidereal with increased confidence. If by some chance the
current bearer either of that Exaltation (or soul, in the case of
Parametadivisions which do not mimic Exalts) comes within (bearer’s
Essence x 10) yards, that other will feel strangely drawn to the
Discordian, able to locate him except through the strongest of magical
barriers, yet will feel uncomfortable in his presence. Detailed Essence
sight or similar Charms may reveal the Echoing. Certain other very
powerful mimicry effects, such as the Ebon Dragon’s Black Mirror
Shintai, may also trigger this resonance.

Additionally, a number of times per session equal to his Essence, the
character can add one die to any dice pool for each of the Echoed beings
which might have had some relevant knowledge or skill (as adjudicated by
the Storyteller). If the number of successes on this roll exceeds the
character’s Dodge MDV, the Echoes from the past overwhelm the character
and he finds himself unavoidably compelled to act in accordance with the
Motivation and Intimacies of one of those past lives for one scene, as
if subject to an overflowing of Hodge. On the other hand, if the roll is
botched, the character is underwhelmed with the wisdom he receives and
is compelled to act against that past life, as with an overflow of
Podge. Neither of these conditions actually affects the character’s
Hodge or Podge tracks. If the character is subject to an overflow of
Hodge or Podge in the same scene where Echoes have already overtaken
him, the overflowing tracks are reset but the effects are delayed until
the start of the next scene.

[[Erisian_Elements,Erisian Elements]]
=== Erisian Elements

indexterm:[-,Erisian Elements]
indexterm:[-,Elements,Erisian]All who live in or near Creation are aware of
the five Elements which define it. Those with long memories and arcane
knowledge are aware of at least one other, vitriol--not to mention those which
permeate the body of Autochthon. The Chosen of Eris, however, have been given
a glimpse of the extent to which the set of elements is as much part of the
imagination as of reality. The Bringers of Confusion each have power over an
element not normally seen in Creation--not because it is absent, but simply
because it is not perceived as such.

The Priests of Disruption are able to exercise powers of Erisian
Elemental Expression (as an Occult Charm) and Erisian Elemental
Rejuvenation (as a Resistance Charm), similar to those available to
elementals (Exalted, p. 302). They work only with the element matching
their Parametadivision. In addition, if they have the ability to summon
elementals, they may choose to summon those normally resident in
Creation or, if conditions are suitable, conjure up a representative of
any of the elements which Eris has made visible to her followers. Since
there is little belief on the part of mortals in these things being
elements, the elementals which manifest them will rarely reach an
Essence of 3, and never greater than 4--at least, not without radical
changes to Creation (or expansion into the Wyld).

The purview of each elemental type is as follows.

*Orange:* Anything colored more-or-less orange--fruit such as oranges and
peaches; sunrises and sunsets; glowing embers; fading leaves; various
creatures, from cats to demons.

*Sweet:* The literal sensation of food and drink, plus some other things
pleasurable and energizing--fruits such as strawberries and peaches; new
love, and old; the glow after love-making; fitting revenge; religious
ecstasy.

*Boom:* Explosions from various sources--burning or mixing certain
unstable materials; rapid changes in or releases of pressure; sudden
anger; riots and fierce battles; accidents with demesnes and manses.

*Pungent:* Strong smells and tastes, hard to conceal--lilies, incense,
rich wine; rotting meat, truffles, strong cheese; body odor; fervor,
sexual vigor or deviance, bigotry; blatant lies; great art and beauty.

*Prickle:* Unease, physical or otherwise--uncomfortable furniture; the
sense of being watched; the feeling of being about to cough or sneeze;
``pins and needles'' in a limb; mild but persistent harassment;
unnecessary rules.

*Dirt:* Distasteful things, or things where they are not wanted--earth,
dust, stains; manure, decayed plant matter, corpses, zombies; invaders,
refugees, the homeless; natural disarray; disgust, crude comments;
scandal, slander and gossip.

*Focus:* Unwavering attention to a person, activity, idea etc.--devotion,
worship, zeal; idealistic love or incurable hatred; dedication to a
profession, masterful construction; meditation, trance.

*Dream:* Unreal things brought to mind--the stories and fears of sleep,
natural or otherwise; hopes, aspirations and goals; unattainable
perfection, frustration; daydreams, distraction, withdrawal from
reality.

*Binding:* Things constrained, externally or by their natural
relationships--imprisonment, slavery, cultism, allegiance; marriage,
family ties, debts and oaths; canals, cement, manacles, retaining walls,
ripening fruit.

Exactly which locations or experiences count as sufficiently ``raw'' as to
be usable for Elemental Rejuvenation is left to the Storyteller’s
discretion. The orange anima of the Anchor Division is only powerful
enough during those actions on which it flares to its full glory. The
Indivisibles are likely to heal surprisingly quickly overnight; members
of the Division by Zero have been known to carry boxes of earth around
to sleep in; and those in the Sub-Division bound by a particularly
onerous oath sanctified by an Eclipse-caste Solar might find it has some
peculiar side-effects.
