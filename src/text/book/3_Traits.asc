== Traits

=== Divisions

``Divide and conquer!''

Where other Exalted split themselves into Castes, Erisians take the more
direct route and call these splits ``Divisions''. Followers of the Most
Beautiful will of course proclaim allegiance to all sorts of other
organizations, as it suits them; but these more fundamental
classifications come from the powers granted to them by That Woman, and
are based on how they relate to themselves and the rest of reality. Each
Division has a Divisional mark, five favored Abilities and a number of
anima powers. The names and symbols of the Divisions are intuitively
understood by all Erisian Exalted, but so far few others recognize them.
The Immaculates, if they were to see a Discordian truly, would know him
as Anathema but have no specific appellations beyond that; their
sobriquets are names they have invented for themselves.

Besides the nature inherent to their Exaltation, each also belongs to a
Parametadivision, which mimics and has an Affinity with one of the other
Exalted types, or some other group of powerful beings. This alignment
provides additional anima powers and has an associated Erisian Element
and, in most cases, a magical material. Some Parameta­divisions may
provide other specific additions or changes to traits and powers. Under
certain circum­stances, a character’s Parameta­division can change.

==== Discordian Anima

Each Division has an anima with a particular color. As a character
expends Peripheral Essence, this anima shows itself, first simply as a
mark on the forehead, then as a subtle amorphous glow, and eventually as
a vivid bonfire of light. As the brightness increases to higher levels,
its glow includes some iconic imagery unique to the character.

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|====
|Motes of Peripheral Essence |Effects
|1-3|
The Divisional mark glitters on the character’s forehead and may be seen
from some angles. A successful (Perception + Awareness) roll at
difficulty 3 allows a character to notice the symbol. The symbol can be
covered to prevent it being noticed.
|4-7|
The mark glows brighter, reducing the difficulty of the (Perception
+ Awareness) roll to 1.
|8-10|
The mark burns brightly and is evident to any who see it, though it may
still be covered. Natural attempts at stealth are at +2 difficulty,
though Charms still function as normal. The character is surrounded by a
dim glow, visible in darkness or against contrasting colors. It shows
none of the character’s iconic anima imagery.
|11-15|
The Divisional mark shines through any concealment, and the dim glow
around the character increases to a bright light making the character
clearly visible up to 20-30 yards away, providing enough light to read
by up to 2-3 yards. Hints of the character’s iconic imagery appear and
disappear around the fringes of the glow. Stealth is impossible,
including use of Charms or other magic.
|16+|
In every action in which the character spends motes, the anima glow
flares up to a bonfire, clearly showing its iconic imagery. The light is
sufficient to read by up to 10 yards and the character can be seen up to
a mile away. The glow subsides to the previous level in any action in
which the character does not spend peripheral Essence.
|====

In addition, every Discordian can activate the following common anima
effects.

* By spending 1 mote she can cause her Divisional mark to glow brightly
for a scene, as if having spent 8-10 motes of Peripheral Essence (though
this does not cause anima flare).

<<<
==== 1st Division: Anchor

TODO: Fix mention in Charms of Sobriquets which now belong to
Parametadivisions; and of orange anima glow.

Those in the Anchor Division find their inspiration and power in
instincts and impulses. They are half-emergent from the mud, grounded
and fluid, self-aware of their borderless selves. They can be
undefeatable, not because they can withstand all comers but because they
do not observe the division between self and opponent.

Common choices of Parametadivision would be Good from Bad, Night from
Day, the Sub-Division or even the Indivisibles. Like Solars they are
full of belief in their own power and righteousness, more because they
ignore others than because they set themselves above everyone else. Like
Lunars they are creatures of sometimes animal instinct. And like the
Yozi and their Chosen, they can tend to see the world through a focus of
their own beliefs, failing to understand others. In some cases they may
even have some connection with raksha, where they are low in Graces, or
in bedlam.

*Symbol:* TODO

*Anima color:* Orange

*Anima effects:* TODO: By spending 5 motes, an Anchorite can enhance their
self-focus to unnatural levels. The player rolls (Essence) dice and
subtracts the number of successes from all internal penalties of any
sort (e.g., from wounds) for the rest of the scene. This effect applies
automatically once his anima banner reaches the 8-10 mote level.

*Associations:* Id, Pre-conscious desire; Narcis­sus, Being-One; Focus,
Self-sustenance; Thoughtless Selfishness

*Sobriquets:* The Most Beautiful; Anchorites; The Voices Whistling in the
Dark; The Ignorant Children; The Traveling Sailsmen; Monks of the Inaccurate
Order

*Concepts:* itinerant hermit, martial monk, long-distance sailor,
barbarian hunter, watchman, woods­man, explorer

*Abilities:* Athletics, Awareness, Martial Arts, Sail, Survival

*Quote:* TODO. ``Make me one with everything''? ``It’s all one to me''? ``It
is bad when one thing becomes two.''

<<<
==== 2nd Division: Arrow

The Arrows of Eris pierce the boundary of the self, bridging the inner
and outer aspects of being. They understand that to achieve one’s own
goals, one must gain the help of others, and work round or co-opt their
desires. They can be beguiling and friendly but are ready to bring their
manipulations to a sharper focus if necessary to get to the heart of the
matter.

Popular Parametadivisions for these characters are Night from Day, Might
from Will and the Indivisibles: Lunars, Sidereals and raksha (with
sufficient Grace) are often consummate manipulators, each in their own
way.

*Symbol:* TODO

*Anima color:* Pink

*Anima effects:* By spending 5 motes, a Mirror-Bearer can skilfully read the
desires of those around her. This grants her a bonus number of dice equal to
her Essence on any Investigation or Socialize rolls for Reading Motivation of
a single subject. The bonus may apply to multiple rolls targeting separate
individuals in a scene, but does not apply to rolls targeting more than one
being. This bonus is not included in the limit for dice added by
Charms. (TODO: This effect applies automatically once her anima banner reaches
the 8-10 mote level. ???)

*Associations:* Ego, negotiation and persuasion; Conscious and
compromising Desire; Lovers, Becoming-One; Curiosity; Self-sacrifice;
Loneliness

*Sobriquets:* Matchmakers; The Soft and Steady Hand; The Mirror-Bearers;
The Heart-Strung; Puppeteers

*Concepts:* treasure-hunter, wandering bard or clown, state inquisitor,
hedge-wizard, evangelical missionary, _agent provocateur_

*Abilities:* Archery, Investigation, Medicine, Performance, Ride

*Quote:* TODO

<<<
==== 3rd Division: Apple

The Apples of Eris’ eye are made to be seen and tasted, as an
inspiration and a focus of action. They throw themselves into the midst
of situations and are at home in conflict, whether or not it is of their
own making. The leaders, fighters and executive action brigade of the
Discordians, this Division makes things happen by organizing,
persuading, confusing or, if necessary, hitting large numbers of people
until they act together. To this end they will apply or disregard rules
and restrictions as suits them.

These Chosen may find themselves drawn to the Parametadivisions of Good
from Bad, Seed from Tree or Blood from Stone slightly more than others.
Solars are the ultimate imposing Exalted and designed to be leaders. The
Dragon-Blooded have fulfilled that role reasonably in the Second Age,
and the Realm is an impressively well-organized society, if ripe for
stirring up. Alchemical Exalted are ``born'' to lead their people, too, in
practical terms and as inspirations.

*Symbol:* TODO

*Anima color:* Pale green

*Anima effects:* TODO [Ditch this and just use the 2nd para, which is more
like Terrestrial (Ability) Reinforcement?] By spending 10 motes an Apple
Corpsman can alter the effectiveness of those he works with for the scene. In
mass combat he may raise or lower the Drill or Valor of a unit in which he
hold a significant position (not necessarily overall command), by one
point. In social combat, he can raise or lower the Loyalty or (number of
nearby extras permitting) Magnitude of a social unit, by one point. Extras
added to or removed from a unit will drift back to their original associations
once the effect ends, slightly puzzled as to why they ended up elsewhere. This
effect costs 5 motes once his anima banner reaches the 11-15 mote level; it is
not reduced further at the 16+ level.

TODO: By spending 5 motes, the soldiers of the Apple Corps can enhance the
abilities of those working with them, choosing a single Ability to enhance for
a given scene. During each action the character takes, he has a pool of
(Essence x 2) dice which he can add to any roll (or static calculation, like
DV) involving the selected Ability by any other being within (Essence x 5)
yards [figured differently in mass combat?]. The dice may be split among
multiple actions by multiple beings, but the total dice added to any roll may
not exceed normal limits for the target. If the target is a mortal or of some
other kind which does not have powers to add dice up to a limit, the
Discordian limit calculation is used, with the target’s traits. This dice pool
is refreshed at the start of the character’s next action. This effect
activates automatically once the character’s anima is flaring at the 11-15
mote level.

*Associations:* Super-ego; Virtue, Law; Team­work, Competition;
Community, Pride; Strife, Jealousy

*Sobriquets:* The Apple Corps; Tower-Builders; Taskmasters; Overseers;
Offendis

*Concepts:* Realm Talon-leader, ambitious war-lord, influential
courtier, Confederation of Rivers diplomat, popular foreman

*Abilities:* Linguistics, Melee, Presence, Socialize, War

*Quote:* TODO

<<<
==== 4th Division: Archway

They who stand in the Archway are those who cannot help but notice the
gaps, correspondences and short-cuts between one thing and another. The
place they stand connects the physical and the immaterial, the seen and
the unseen, the here and there, the realms of reality, the truth and the
other truth. They seek to uncover mundane and mystical secrets and
understanding, sometimes to set themselves above others, other times to
set them free. They are often peripherally involved in multiple sizable
covert organizations or networks, to spy on, subvert or control them.
Exalted of this Division count as priests, though that does not
automatically make them Holy.

The most obvious choices of Parametadivision for these Exalts are those
of Might from Will and the Sub-Division, but Night from Day and the
Indivisi­bles are not uncommon. Sidereals work with one of the most
powerful magical underpinnings of everyday Creation, and they are
themselves obscured, since the breaking of the Mask. Infernals have made
much of their preparations in secret, hidden away from mortals, but are
working to bridge once of the greatest magical gaps of all. Lunars and
raksha alike are found on the fringes of Creation where it unwinds into
the Wyld fabric from which it was wrought.

*Symbol:* TODO

*Anima color:* Indigo

*Anima effects:* TODO: Spending 5 motes gives the Gatekeeper insight into how
to bypass barriers, for the rest of the scene. This grants her a bonus number
of dice equal to her Essence on Larceny attempts to pick locks, or on
appropriate rolls (e.g., Perception + Occult, Intelligence + Lore) to
understand how to open artifact doors, mystical portals etc. This power does
not directly reveal the location of hidden portals, but the knowledge of how
to open them may be sufficient, or may imply their location. On the other
hand, knowledge may not be enough: the Gatekeeper may learn that the
quartermaster’s key will open the door, but will not magically gain the
key. Additionally, in melee and mass combat this power reduces by -1 any
bonuses a target gains to his DV from shields or cover. These effects applies
automatically once her anima banner reaches the 8-10 mote level.

*Associations:* Collective Unconscious; Mystery, Learning, Confusion;
Flexibility; Transgression, Duplicity

*Sobriquets:* They Who Stand in the Doorway; The Gatekeepers; The
Unhinged; Mid-day Shadows; Invaders of the Faith

*Concepts:* practicing mystic, escapologist and knife-thrower, crime
lord, cult activist, spy-master or double agent, demon-summoner

*Abilities:* Dodge, Larceny, Occult, Thrown, Stealth

*Quote:* ``The Grey Illusion is that all realms of reality have their
underlying rules.  The Erisian Illusion is that they have none.''

<<<
==== 5th Division: Anvil

The Chosen of this Division are defined by their awareness of the
structures and patterns which suffuse and support all things, large and
small. Even in the Wyld, the shifting stories of the raksha have their
own narrative rules; even Oblivion has its own ever-expanding shape, and
a subtle texture to the screams which echo from its maw.

The systems they work with are the same ones the Archway poke holes
through. The Authority struggles at times to remember that order is as
much an illusion and an invention of the mind as chaos, but finds it
convenient to use the flaws in every system to chisel and beat the world
into shape on the Anvil of themselves. Some gleefully oppose the
Chaos-bringing efforts of other Discordian Exalted. As one of their many
holy books said: ``Eristic Avatars are sent down into Creation, for the
purpose of keeping things from becoming so well ordered that they stop
working. This they often accomplish by insisting that certain arbitrary
interpretations of reality are the only valid ones. That causes Strife
which results in Confusion which revitalizes Holy Chaos.''

The Parametadivision of Blood from Stone and the Division of Labor
attract many of the Architects, with others not infrequently choosing
Seed from Tree or, perhaps surprisingly, the Indivisibles. Alchemi­cals
are crafted by the Maker, so the building of structures is in what
passes for their blood. The Mountain Folk are rigid in themselves, and
bound. The Realm and its outposts is one of the most visible
organizations in Creation, if not always the most effective. Lastly, the
raksha claim to abhor form but cannot help playing with it, and even the
great unshaped are aware of it in some part of their being.

=== Parametadivisions

The Chosen of Eris have been created to sow confusion and discord and, to this
end, are inherently able to mimic one type of Exalt or other powerful being,
according to an aspect known as their Parametadivision.  This is chosen at
character creation time, but may be changed later through the ritual of
Divisional Realignment (see <<Divisional Realignment>>).

Each type mimicked contains further sub-types--Exalted castes, for
example. The character must choose an initial sub-type to mimic, but may
change this indefinitely at any time by taking a miscellaneous action.
For some Parametadivisions this change may affect ongoing anima effects,
as described in the relevant following section.

If the character changes sub-type she may also change minor details of
her appearance as a Shaping effect. Assuming they recall clearly through
the effects of her Recumbent Destiny, others will not recognize her from
her normal appearance or that of any other of her sub-type forms unless
they succeed on a (Perception + Awareness) roll at a difficulty of the
character’s (Essence ÷ 2). They may substitute Investigation or Larceny
for Awareness if they already have reason to suspect the character may
not be who she appears to be. The character may have only one
alternative appearance associated with each sub-type.

(TODO: Need something for Dragon Kings?)

(TODO: Nocturnals: Warp from Weft? Or should they be Night from Day, and
``Lunars'' be ... Skin from Soul/Bone, Heart from Whole, ... ?)

==== Anima Mimicry

Erisians are able to use their anima appearance and powers to support
their Parametadivisional impersonation of different Exalted types. Each
can at least approximate the outward appearance of the most significant
anima powers of those they impersonate.

(TODO: revisit anima powers to make sure obvious, automatic ones are
mimicked, e.g., the Abyssal one about auto-raising zombies.)

When it is visible, Discordians can reflexively, at no cost, make their
anima appear to belong to the Exalted type and caste fitting their
Parameta­divisional Affinity. By spending 3 motes, they can change this
appearance to any other Parameta­divisional type and caste for one
scene. Mimicking another Exalted anima in this way includes the anima
getting brighter at the levels appropriate for that Exalted type,
including any penalties to Stealth and so on. If mimicking a caste which
can flare its anima even further than normal, such as the Solar Zenith
or Infernal Malefactor castes, the character can do the same at the cost
of 2 motes, or at no cost whenever their anima flares at the 16+ level,
though it is a purely cosmetic effect. For those types whose anima
includes iconic imagery, the image will be different from the
character’s Erisian anima, but have something in common with it.

To aid in infiltrating various power groups, they can commit 5 motes and
1 willpower to change their apparent Essence signature indefinitely,
regardless of whether their anima is visible (_e.g._, even when they are
asleep), but only according to their Affinity. Alternatively, they can
commit that Essence and willpower to hide the fact that they have
enlightened Essence at all, making them appear to be an ordinary mortal
of Essence 1 (or, if they normally have Essence 4 or more, a heroic
mortal with Essence 2 and no mote pool). This effect continues even as
the Exalt spends motes, though observers may be able to determine the
source of the power.

Unless they are mimicking the type with which they have an Affinity, use
of an Obvious Charm or an expenditure of 11 or more motes of their
Peripheral Essence causes the effect to end immediately, and the
willpower is no longer committed.

When their anima appearance is changed in this way, be it for a scene or
indefinitely, magical powers which can determine the type of an Exalt’s
Essence (such as the Solar Charm All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight) will
also perceive the purported type. Attempts to see through this (_e.g._,
using a Charm such as Eye of the Unconquered Sun) add the Exalt’s
Essence to their difficulty or, in the case of a contested roll, the
character adds (Essence) successes. This alteration is a Shaping effect
rather than an Illusion. Effects which prevent Shaping will nonetheless
not prevent this alteration or suppression of apparent anima, unless
they are specifically crafted to that end.

===== Other Affinity Effects

In order that they may blend in with those they are trying to influence,
the Affinity of a Discordian also confers upon them any cosmetic effects
which would be appropriate. For example, those in the Parametadivision
called the The Division by Zero will give a fairly convincing impression
of walking corpses, whereas those in the Division of Night from Day have
animal tells, and those in the Division of Seed from Tree show some of
the elemental coloring of the Dragon-Blooded, if their Essence is high
enough.

Those Erisians bearing an apparent Essence signature befitting a
creature of darkness are treated as such, for the purposes of Charms and
other effects. They may take extra damage from Holy effect, for example,
and cannot themselves use Holy Charms, though they may learn them.

(TODO: Cosmetic Charm mimicry?)

<<<
==== The Division of Good from Bad

Erisians of this Parametadivision take on the mantle of excellence and
leadership to reflect the light of the Solars. They inspire others by
example, taking control where it suits them, pushing and dragging others
to where they need to be. Equally they will shine a light on what they
see as wrong or deficient, whether or not they have an alternative in
mind: upheaval is preferable to broken order. They are rarely hidden,
unless that is what they excel in, and unlikely to be overlooked.

*Element:* Orange

*Magical Material:* Orichalcum

*Affinity:* Solar

*Anima effects:* Common Solar anima effects, at a cost of 1 mote each:

* Cause her caste mark to glow brightly for a scene (as if the character
had spend 4-7 motes of Peripheral Essence).
* Cause her anima to glow brightly enough to read by for a scene (as if
the character had spent 8-10 motes of Peripheral Essence).
* Know the precise time of day for the rest of the scene.

TODO: By spending 10 motes, a [sobriquet] can reflect some of the Holy power
of the Solars. For the rest of the scene, she adds (Essence) dice to any kind
of attack [and/or defense?] roll against creatures of darkness. The anima
power actives automatically once the character spends 11-15 motes of
Peripheral Essence.

*Associations:* Beautiful Sunsets; TODO

*Sobriquets:* The Law Unto Themselves, TODO

*Concepts:* ronin, elite palace guard, charismatic king, campaigner for
Elemental rights, rising star of the Guild

*Quote:* ``The Nagas of the South-East Mountain Tribes say that the sun

<<<
==== The Division of Night from Day

The Chosen who take to this Parametadivision ape the Chosen of Luna and,
being born of confusion, are quite at home in mimicking their volatile
natures. They change their forms, opinions, tactics and allegiances at
whim; they will hold at least some more enduring values and loyalties,
but even these are not immutable.

They have some form of marking or animal characteristic, similar to the
Lunars’ Tell, manifesting in any form they take. This is both less
obvious and less magical than a true Tell. It can be hidden under
clothing and need not make one think of animals or Lunars without other
reasons to do so, or unless the player wishes it so. Nonetheless,
someone who notices it on the character in more than one form will be
aware that those forms are connected somehow, even through the confusion
of Recumbent Destiny. There is no Illusion hiding it, but the difficulty
to notice it with a (Perception + Awareness) roll is equal to the
character’s (Willpower + [Essence ÷ 2]).

The Moonlight Lyres may choose to carry silvery tattoos as well. These
tattoos are not really moonsilver and never form the correct patterns to
have their intended effect in any case. A contested (Perception \+
Occult) roll against the same difficulty as before may find a flaw in
the tattoo’s design revealing it as not quite Lunar and not really
moonsilver, if any have cause to look for it.

For both pseudo-tell and fake tattoos, the Storyteller may apply bonuses
of +1 to +5 to observers’ rolls, depending on how familiar they are with
Lunars, how actively they are looking for these signs, and so on. Lastly
note that the forms of these markings are selected when the character
joins the Parametadivision and cannot be changed thereafter.

*Element:* Sweet

*Magical Material:* Moonsilver

*Affinity:* Lunar

*Anima effects:* Common Lunar anima effects, at a cost of 1 mote each:

* Cause her caste mark and tattoos to glow brightly for a scene (as if
the character has spent four to seven motes of Peripheral Essence).
* Cause her anima to glow brightly enough to read by for a scene (as if
the character has spent eight to 10 motes of Peripheral Essence).
* Cause her pseudo-Tell to become unmistak­able and impossible to miss
as being (apparently) a Tell.
* Know the precise day of the lunar month, the phase of the moon and the
time of day for the rest of the scene.

By spending 1 mote the character may cause her tattoos (if any) and
pseudo-Tell to completely vanish for one scene.

By spending 10 motes, a Moonlight Lyre can take on the form of any type
of creature she has seen, roughly equivalent in mass to her normal form,
for one scene. She cannot duplicate individual creatures exactly. This
is a true transformation, a Shaping effect rather than an Illusion, but
it is a superficial one. She retains her normal Attribute and Ability
ratings, combat statistics and so on, and close inspection by an expert
will reveal that the creature is somehow unnatural. She can take on the
form of ``some mortal'' or other intelligent race but that grants a bonus
of +2 to those attempting to spot something unusual, because clothes,
weapons etc. will be joined to and inseparable from the rest of the
body.

Physical abilities based solely on the outward form of the creature,
such as flight, swimming and so on are also limited, though multiplied
by the character’s Essence score; e.g., flight speed will be limited to
(running speed x Essence). Abilities requiring complex internal anatomy,
such as breathing underwater, spinning silk, or spitting venom, are not
granted.

This effect costs 5 motes once his anima banner reaches the 11-15 mote
level and 2 motes at the 16+ level. The character may also invoke it
reflexively if subject to a Shaping effect, such as Wyld mutation, which
would solely or partly alter her appearance in a way consistent with
this power. In that case, her anima power acts as a perfect defense
against the Shaping effect, but automatically copies the intended shape.

==== The Division of Seed from Tree

The Princes of the Earth are the lucky ones flattered by the imitations
of this Parametadivision. Though hostile to all ``anathema'', the
Dragon-Blooded are an influential, wide-spread, mobile host, organized
but far from acting in perfect harmony: sometimes it is easiest to hide
a tree in the forest. These Erisians will work together with their
fellows and followers for the good of some group, as they believe Eris
would see it. That said, the group they lead may not be quite the same
as the one they’re trying to help.

Knights of the Five-Sided Temple must choose a particular Elemental type
to mimic initially but can change this as described below.

*Element:* Boom

*Magical Material:* Jade

*Affinity:* Dragon-Blooded

*Anima effects:* If the character takes a miscellaneous action to change to a
different element while anima powers are in use, this will cancel their
effect--and doubtless confuse any onlookers-- ... TODO: ... though the anima
may re-activate automatically for the new element if the character has spent
enough motes of Peripheral Essence.

By spending (TODO: 10?) motes, a character may gain some benefits of his
selected element for one scene. Firstly, he may add his Essence in dice to
attempts to resist damage from environmental effects of that element, where
Wood includes plant toxins. Secondly, at Step 10 of attack resolution, he may
subtract 1 from any damage caused by the relevant element, to a minimum of 0,
even if it is not from an environmental source. For example, this applies to
damage from the anima power of a Fire Aspect Dragon-Blooded. Lastly, a
specific power is available corresponding to each element, as a Shaping
effect.

* For Air, leaping distance is multiplied by the his Essence.
* For Earth, his Essence is added to rolls to resist grappling or
knockback.
* For Fire, he can ignite flammable materials with a touch.
* For Water, he can breathe water as easily as air, and will not drown.
* For Wood, he can exude a mild plant toxin: living creatures with whom
he makes skin-to-skin contact must make a successful (Stamina \+
Resistance) roll against the character’s Essence or be affected for the
rest of the scene. The poison causes no damage but imposes a -1 internal
penalty due to nausea. Multiple doses stack their penalties, up to the
character’s (Essence ÷ 2).

Peripheral Essence expenditure. ???)

*Concepts:* oblivious sybarite, scheming courtier, impassioned
politician, sorcery researcher, apparently-reliable army officer

*Other rules:* Anima flux does not truly apply to those Exalts in this
Parametadivision, though an Illusion of that raw elemental power will
manifest, within a number of feet equal to the character’s permanent
Essence. At the 8-10-mote level it will feel distinctly uncomfortable
but will not cause damage or other adverse effects. At the 11-15-mote
level it imposes 1 _die_ of external penalty (i.e., zero or one levels)
on each attack or other action directed at the Exalt, from characters
who are unable to soak lethal damage with Stamina (i.e., excluding
Exalts), as they instinctively try to avoid the (non-existent) damage.
At the 16+ level it imposes a number of penalty _dice_ equal to the
character’s permanent Essence, which applies to all characters. This
Illusion may be subconsciously resisted for a scene by spending one
Willpower, but observers must spend a further three Willpower to
recognize the Illusion for what it is, and remember it. In that case,
the Illusion will not affect them for the rest of the story. This in
itself will not necessarily cause onlookers to realize that the
character is not a Dragon-Blood, but it may raise their suspicions.

==== The Division of Might from Will

To turn what could be into what is, one needs both direction and action,
wisdom and strength. Erisians who work with this understanding act like
the Sidereals, guiding others along paths by keeping these two threads
in harmony, or diverting them by twisting or breaking one or both.
Commonly they prefer to pull strings in the background but they are
known also to wade into the middle of things to untangle a mess, or step
up to be seen as a sign and guiding light to others.

*Element:* Pungent

*Magical Material:* Starmetal

*Affinity:* Sidereal

*Anima effects:* Common Sidereal anima effects, at a cost of 1 mote
each:

* Make her caste mark obvious for one minute, as if the character had
spent 8-10 motes of Peripheral Essence.
* Know the exact time and date by sensing the position of celestial
bodies--or other significant bodies, meaning this ability works in realms
such as Malfeas or (insofar as time has meaning there) the Wyld.
* Attune her anima to the ripples cast by doorways between worlds. For
the rest of the scene, the character recognizes the presence of gateways
to Heaven, Malfeas, the Underworld, the Wyld, Autochthonia, Elsewhere or
any other alternative reality, within (Essence x 100) feet. She does not
learn the gateway’s precise location, only that it is present.

[TODO: Is the following a bit meh? Is it something all Discordians
should be able to do, as well as switch between being or not being
Creatures of Darkness?]

By spending 10 motes, one of the Foolish Sages gains the ability to step
fully into or out of Fate, for one scene. The character may change his
status any number of times within the scene, but each change requires a
miscellaneous action. Alternatively the character can pay a further 2
motes on a given action to make it reflexive, and may do so
automatically whenever a Fate-based effect could target him. Stepping
outside Fate grants immunity to any Charms with the Fate keyword, to the
crafting or transferring of crafted destinies, and to being located via
the Loom of Fate. It will not remove a destiny or Fate-based effect
which has already been applied, unless the description of that effect
states that it works in that way. Stepping fully into Fate, the Exalt
allows Fate-based effects to occur as normal. The confusion of identity
that the Recumbent Destiny causes is not removed, as it is not really a
Fate-based effect. A Foolish Sage who enters Autochthonia will soon
realize that he can step into or out of the Design of Autochthon as
well. He cannot be within the Design and the Loom simultaneously,
however. This effect costs 5 motes once her anima banner reaches the
11-15 mote level and 2 motes at the 16+ level.

==== The Division of Blood from Stone

Just as the Maker’s Chosen are constructed in the image of mortals, to
give them a face which is not too foreign to the populace, so Erisians
of this Parametadivision don a new skin to walk un­challenged among
those alien cultures. They are aware that, particularly in Autochthonia,
they are a piece in a large machine; but they also know that every
living cog has its own will and destiny.

Members of the Seventh Column must choose a particular Alchemical type
to mimic initially, but can change that later.

*Element:* Prickle

*Magical Material:* Any of orichalcum, moon­silver, jade, starmetal,
soulsteel, and adamant.

*Affinity:* Alchemical

*Anima effects:*

Common Alchemical anima effects, at a cost of 1 mote each:

* Cause her anima banner to flare up to any desired level of display for
the rest of the scene.

The character may take a miscellaneous action to change small details of
her appearance, to mimic the installation of different Charms. In this
case she remains recognizably the same and this is not suspicious to
Autochthonian natives. Alternatively the character may adopt the
appearance of an Apostate with Voidtech Charms, with the expected
effects on her encounters. This does not itself change her material
alignment.

If the character changes material while anima powers are in use, this will
cancel their effect--and doubtless confuse any onlookers-- (TODO: though the
anima may re-activate automatically for the new element if she has spent
enough motes of Peripheral Essence. ???) If changing alignment means that it
no longer matches some artifacts which a character has already attuned, the
attunement is unaffected, but he will no longer gain material-specific bonuses
when wielding it, unless and until his anima powers are activated.

TODO: By spending 10 motes reflexively, one of the Greys can gain access to
the material-specific bonuses of all his attuned artifacts, regardless of his
own current alignment, at no additional attunement cost and without the need
for a (Wits + Lore) roll. In the case of weapons and armor made from the
magical materials, the character may optionally replace the bonuses of any
item with those for the material with which he is currently aligned. This
power has no effect on artifacts tainted with Vitriol.

TODO: If the character is not wielding a weapon made from the magical
materials--either because his weapon is made of something else, or he
wields no weapon--he nonetheless gains the attack bonuses of his own
material. Defense bonuses are applied similarly to characters not
wearing armor made of the magical materials. This effect lasts for one
scene, and applies automatically once her anima banner reaches the 11-15
mote level.

*Associations:* Faith, Dogma, Tools; Hierarchy, Society, Service, the
Greater Good; Conflicting Loyalties, Conflicted Madness

*Sobriquets:* Bishops of Greyface; Greys; Loose Cogs; The Seventh
Column; TODO

*Concepts:* re-interpreter of dogma, conciliatory Apostate,
trans-national ambassador, covert visitor from Creation, fervent
nationalist

*Other rules:* The cosmetic effects of the Bishops’ Exalted Affinity
extend to them leaving chemical trails as anima levels rise. However,
this is only an Illusion and will gradually fade, vanishing by the end
of the scene. The usual rules for resisting Illusions apply, though
onlookers will generally not do so unless they are specifically looking
for Illusions or have a reason to suspect the Erisian is not the
Alchemical she appears to be.

Erisians in this Parametadivision cannot be re-fitted or repaired in
Alchemical vats and will not increase in size as their Essence rises,
though their bearing may become more imposing. To some Alchemicals, this
may be enough to give away their foreign nature.

*Quote:* ``The part with the greatest number of degrees of freedom
ultimately governs the system.''

==== The Division by Zero

Discordians are drawn to this Parametadivision if they choose to devote
themselves to opposing the Neverborn, the Abyssals, and their mundane
and magical allies. The paths of Erisian Chaos may be about tearing
things down, but more to set them free than not to destroy them. Death
is part of life, but Chaos is never Oblivion, for that is the end of
possibility.

Given the obvious dangers, they are most likely to do their work from
within: wreaking destruction where it will lead to some good; bringing
people to an understanding of endings which avoids despair; freeing
ghosts from the attachments that hold them back from Lethe; sabotaging
Deathlord plans by being too blatant in their actions. At times they
pretend Resonance by using the balance effects of Numerology to cause
damage but leave reparation in their wake.

*Element:* Dirt

*Magical Material:* Soulsteel

*Affinity:* Abyssal

*Anima effects:* Common Abyssal anima effects, at a cost of 1 mote each:

* Cause their anima to flare to any level of display up to the 8–10 mote
level. This display lasts for a scene or until reflexively dismissed,
after which the character’s anima dims to its actual level.
* Attune her Essence to the emanations of the Underworld for a scene,
extending this sixth sense to a radius of (Essence x 100) yards.

By default these Exalted respire normal Essence, except when they choose
to show an Abyssal anima banner, in which case they respire
death-aspected Essence. By spending 1 mote, the character can switch
between respiring normal and death-aspected Essence, until the next
sunset or sunrise (or equivalent time in the Underworld or other realm).

TODO: By spending 10 motes, a Finger of the Left Hand can reanimate a corpse
as a zombie extra, or take control of a single existing zombie (or equivalent)
within a 10-yard range. Both newly-animated and existing zombies affected by
this power decay rapidly, suffering one aggravated level of damage per day
until they disintegrate. If another being actively controls an existing
zombie, it must make a contested (Essence + Willpower) roll against the
character to retain control. This power works automatically once per action,
when the character has spent 11-15 motes of Peripheral Essence.

TODO: Alternatively the character may reflexively spend 10 motes to take
control of a being which has taken sufficient damage to take it into or past
its Dying health levels. This stabilizes the target at its current level (or
its last Dying health level, if it would have died outright) and heals one
level of lethal damage every 6 ticks, until the being reaches
Incapacitated. At the same time, the being becomes able to move around and act
physically as normal, under the character’s direction as a Total Control
effect. The target cannot interact socially while it remains unconscious, but
its wound penalties are reduced to -2. If the target is healed above
Incapacitated, the control ends immediately. If the target is still
Incapacitated at the end of the scene, the control ends and the being returns
to unconsciousness. This power does not activate automatically beyond a
certain level of anima flare.

(TODO: Ditch the following? ...

By spending 5 motes, a Finger of the Left Hand can focus his life energy
for one scene, overcoming one point worth of any external penalties from
a single source. The character may reflexively spend a further 5 motes
to choose a different source, once per action, at Step 1 or 2 of attack
resolution. This effect applies automatically once his anima banner
reaches the 4-7 mote level, though the character may wait indefinitely
to nominate the source to oppose for that scene.

By spending 10 motes, external penalties up to the character’s Essence
are removed for the scene, from any one source. The source opposed may
be changed once per action as above, by spending a further 5 motes.
Alternatively the character may choose to remove one point of external
penalties from any and all sources for the scene. This effect costs 5
motes once his anima banner reaches the 11-15 mote level; it is not
reduced further at the 16+ level.

==== The Sub-Division

The Chosen of Eris who seek to wrestle with the philosophy of dominance
and oppression may join this Parametadivision, and are as likely to aid
the schemes of the Yozi as to oppose them. What Discordian could but
love the free will which the Primordials gave to mortals, or but sorrow
at how the will of the Yozi is now bound. The struggle to bring any sort
of balance between the prisoners and their jailers is an epic one worthy
of a Discordian.

One who takes this path may choose to gain some vaguely demonic twists
to her form, though these will be cosmetic rather than functional, and
need not resemble any one demon. The details of these deviations can be
changed later, to some extent.

*Element:* Binding

*Magical Material:* Any magical material tainted with Vitriol

*Affinity:* Infernals

*Anima effects:* Common Infernal anima effects, costing one mote each:

* Cause his caste mark to glow brightly for a scene (as if the character
has spent 4-7 motes of Peripheral Essence).
* Cause his caste mark to clearly illuminate everything within a 10 yard
radius for a scene (as if the character has spent 4-7 motes of
Peripheral Essence).
* Sense the nearest entry point into the Yozi realm or the nearest
pathway that leads to the desert of Cecelyne.

As well as the normal Parametadivisional use of a miscellaneous action
to change her apparent caste, the character may do so to change some
cosmetic aspect of her appearance, to mimic demonic mutations or the
effects of Charms such as Viridian Legend Exoskeleton. This change of
appearance is purely cosmetic, offering no benefits beyond persuading
others of her alleged Infernal nature, and does not obscure the
character’s identity.

TODO: By spending 10 motes, of which 5 must remain committed, one of the
Inmates may trade burdens with one who is bound by a magically sanctified
oath. The Discordian character gains the requirements and penalties of the
target’s oath, and the target takes on a new oath, agreed with and sworn to
the character, with the same penalties as the original. An oath can only be
traded in this fashion if the being which originally sanctified it had a lower
Essence than the Exalt herself.  This effect requires the two to shake hands
(or otherwise touch) and the target must be willing. The character may restore
the original oath at any time, by releasing her commitment of motes.

(TODO: Hmm ... have I duplicated this in a general Bureaucracy Charm?)

(TODO: Or, maybe phrase the above as something which offers stat boosts or
guaranteed successes in service of something? Then it could counter Eclipse
style botches _and_ work a little like Cecylene’s training Charms.)

(TODO: Or maybe, provide general bonuses to freeing things--from physical
bindings, mental influence, Malfean imprisonment (i.e., demon summoning),
Intimacies etc.--and penalties to binding things? This could interact with
oaths for the scene, e.g., providing bonuses to break them, or forcing a
contested roll to allow the botch to happen, or ...)

(TODO: Do I need to fake the Scourge-cast silence effect? It’s not automatic,
so I could provide a Charm for it, or players could make custom ones.)

TODO: By spending 10??? motes, a follower of The True Religion can choose to
whether or not to be affected as a Creature of Darkness for one scene,
regardless of their current anima.

==== The Division of Labor

(TODO: Some introductory spiel here.)

*Element:* Focus

*Magical Material:* Jade

*Affinity:* Mountain Folk (Jadeborn)

*Anima effects:* Jadeborn do not have animas nor, therefore, anima
powers. The Erisians of this Parametadivision do, however, and are
unable to truly suppress their anima unless other effects are employed.
If they attempt to make their normal anima appear as a ``Jadeborn anima'',
it will manifest as follows.

(TODO: Convert this to a table?)

1-3 Essence: The Jadeborn aspects of their appearance are enhanced,
making them more striking.

4-7: Jadeborn rocky skin and crystalline or metallic highlights become
unusually pronounced and have a slight glow, to a level which may be
noticed by observant onlookers (roll [Perception + Awareness] at
standard difficulty).

8-10: Jadeborn skin characteristics are strongly enhanced, giving a +1
bonus to Appearance for any effects relating to Jadeborn of the same
Caste. A crystalline mark on the character’s forehead becomes very
pronounced and has a definite glow, noticeable by anyone paying
attention. Stealth Charms are usable but mundane Stealth attempts suffer
a +1 difficulty.

11-15: The character appears to be made from rock, and glitters gently
all over. The Appearance bonus applies to all Jadeborn Castes. Stealth
Charms fail and mundane Stealth attempts suffer a +2 difficulty.

16+: The character appears to be made from unnaturally pure rock and
glows brightly enough to be visible for up to a mile. The Appearance
bonus applies in relation to all other characters and any other effects.
Stealth is impossible.

Their anima grants the following powers.

* Jade Sense: spending 1 mote reflexively allows the Exalt to detect the
existence of jade within (Essence x 5) yards; a further mote gives the
direction; and a third tells whether it contains the soul of a Jadeborn.
This ability is active automatically at the 4-7 mote level.
* TODO: Wyld Resistance: spending 1 mote reflexively gives them (Essence)
extra dice to resist any given Wyld effect. This effect is active
automatically at the 8-10 mote level.

TODO: For 5 motes, the Exalt may carry out any mundane crafting activity as a
Miscellaneous Action, rather than a Dramatic Action, provided the activity can
be completed successfully in a single roll. This ability costs 2 motes at the
4-7 mote anima level, and has no cost at the 11-15 level or above.

TODO: [Need a 10-mote power instead. Either boost this one, or something else.
Something to do with binding oneself to service?]

==== The Indivisibles

Some Fair Folk Courts are undoubtedly aware of the Discordians, and
agitated to find that these Chosen do not pantomime only the others of
their kind from within Creation, but also the natives of the Wyld. For
their part, the Chosen of Eris may venture into the shifting Marches to
bring some Chaos back to Creation, or perhaps to tip the balance of
power and force some order on the place.

TODO: Raksha who enter Creation take on a fixed form for their sojourn there,
and likewise Discordians entering this Parametadivision must choose one form,
roughly equivalent in mass to their original self. They may change this form
arbitrarily each time they cross between the Wyld (Middlemarches or deeper)
and any other realm (Creation, the Underworld etc.). The form offers no
enhancements to their Attributes or Abilities but, although the act of change
is a Shaping effect, the resulting form is not: it becomes the character’s
natural form. If the character leaves this Parametadivision through Divisional
Realignment, she returns to her original form, and any Shaping effects active
upon her are removed.

An Exalt entering the ranks of the Indivisibles also gains latent Graces
and shaping damage tracks corresponding to the values of her Virtues, at
the time she enters the Parametadivision. Her Heart Grace is rated at
(Essence ÷ 2), with a minimum of 2. Raksha can observe and interact with
these Graces as normal. However, except when she uses her anima power to
activate them, she cannot access them for shaping combat and the like,
nor can others use them to influence her. One of the Fair Folk may take
ownership of one of the character’s Graces but, as long as it remains
latent, it grants no hold over the character. The character can spend
experience to raise the values of these Graces as if she were a raksha
commoner. If she leaves this Parameta­division, all such experience is
refunded. If the character acquires Graces through other means, these
are not latent and are tracked separately. When her latent Graces are
active, add the two ratings, to a maximum of 5.

TODO: These Erisians can attune Wyld artifacts and acquire gossamer to power
oneiromantic spells and raksha treasures. They are capable of learning Craft
(Glamour) but cannot apply it without access to suitable Charms--borrowed from
raksha with Charm-Filching Prana, perhaps, or developed personally. They are
also capable of gaining the Gossamer background but it does not grant
Assumption Charms and, unless they have a way of forging gossamer, neither
does it translate into enhanced Resources in Creation.

*Element:* Dream

*Magical Material:* Gossamer

*Affinity:* Fair Folk

*Anima Effects:* As with the Jadeborn, the raksha have no anima, but the
power of the Discordians who mimic them must vent itself. If they
attempt to make their normal anima appear as a ``Fair Folk anima'', it
will manifest in ways which are equivalently noticeable but as
increasingly dramatic enhancements to their chosen appearance. The
changes may not include a glow but will have some other area effect
noticeable from a distance, e.g., an irritating noise of insects, a
blowing of rainbow snow or similar.

An Erisian in this Parametadivision may spend 10 motes to access her latent
Graces for one scene. This enables her to take shaping actions and make
shaping attacks. It also means that she does not restrict the flow of time for
raksha as Creation-born normally do. This anima effect is accessible for no
cost once the character’s anima reaches the 11-15 mote level. If the character
re-activates this power in the immediately following scene, it costs only 5
motes. The character does not have feeding Graces; her dice pool for Join
Shaping Battle is the sum of her two highest Graces. If this power is not
active, the character suffers the results of successful shaping attacks as any
other Creation-born (see <<GWM>>, p. 126).

TODO: Shaping actions are only possible in the Wyld or in uncapped demesnes.
In other places the Indivisible anima allows the character to benefit from
others’ Virtues, in a manner more benign than the raksha’s feeding.  Any time
a being within (Essence x 10) yards channels or suppresses a Virtue, the
character can either regain a single channel of the same Virtue, or heal a
single level of damage to the corresponding shaping damage track. This effect
costs 10 motes, and activates automatically once the character’s anima reaches
the 11-15 mote level. There is no reduced cost to activating it in subsequent
scenes, however. It cannot be used in places where shaping actions are
possible, as the former anima effect applies instead.

[[Divisional_Realignment]]
=== Divisional Realignment

At character creation time the player makes a choice of Division and
Parametadivision. While the former is fixed, the latter need not be. If
a cabal of five or more Erisians from different Divisions meet during
Calibration, they may join in the day-long rite of Divisional
Realignment, at a cost of 8xp. Certain artifacts, manses or other
sources of power might allow the rite to take place at other times or
with fewer participants, perhaps at greater cost. This allows them each
to move to a different Parameta­division. Each Exalt must change, and
all must end up in a different Parametadivision from where they started.
This is not a simple exchange: some may end up in a Parametadivision
different from any the participants originally had.

To aid in impersonating their newly-chosen power group, and as a function of
the way in which unique viewpoints of the Children of Eris shape their world,
each can go further and rebuild his or her Charm trees to a limited
extent. Charms belonging to the Divisional or Favored Abilities selected at
character generation cannot be exchanged, nor can those belonging to Martial
Arts styles. However, Discordian Martial Arts Charms which do not belong to
any style, or which are character-specific extensions to a style, can be
exchanged--unless Martial Arts is a Divisional or Favored Ability.  Up to
(Essence x 3) Charms from other Abilities may be un-learned and instantly
replaced with other Charms from any Ability, or from any Martial Arts style of
which the character already knows at least one Charm. Normal prerequisite
constraints apply: the character cannot un-learn a Charm but keep Charms which
have it as a prerequisite, nor learn new Charms without first learning their
prerequisites. Discordians cannot normally learn Charms from other types of
magical beings but, should a Child find a way, they will be unable to exchange
such Charms during Divisional Realignment.

This Charm exchange is also available to a lesser extent as an extension of
the self-development which occurs when an Erisian raises his Essence.  When a
player has spent the necessary experience to do this, and the character the
necessary time, up to (Essence) Charms may be exchanged at that time,
following the above constraints.

=== The Not-So-Great Curse

[TODO: Remove specific mention of Hodge and Podge from Charms as much as
possible.]

It may be because the Discordian Exalted were created long after the
Primordial War, or successfully hid any involvement they had, or because
their matron really is a Primordial, but somehow they have avoided the
effects of the Great Curse. However, their Exaltations have been
constructed imperfectly (or made to be perfectly imperfect?), so they
don’t get off entirely lightly. Rather than Limit, these Exalted accrue
points in two separate measures, Hodge and Podge. When a character
spends Willpower to channel her primary Virtue, or when she applies
unnatural mental influence or a Shaping effect to a target and that
target successfully resists, she gains a point of Hodge--overriding the
will and actions of the individual, their inherent chaos, is just wrong,
y’see. When she spends Willpower to act against her primary Virtue or
resist unnatural mental influence, or resists or removes a Shaping
effect applied by someone other than herself, she gains a point of
Podge--resisting the your own urges and the will of others suppresses
disorder in another way. In either case she can gain no more than one
point of each per scene.

[TODO: Should I swap the effects of Hodge and Podge? It feels like the
consequences of _both_ should be giving in to other forces, but that
doesn’t make much sense

Should I bring back Divisional Virtues, and their influence along with
the primary Virtue? Gaining Hodge for channeling a Virtue isn’t great.

Also, I added in Shaping as a trigger--is that a good idea?]

When the count of Hodge reaches 10 (or more), the character is driven to
oppose the tenets, tendencies and desires of the dominant order, as she
understands them. The dominant order is determined as follows. If there
is a single character present in the scene with a higher Essence than
all others (including the Discordian), their beliefs are taken on.
Beings which the character cannot perceive are ignored for this effect.
The character need not know the precise beliefs of the individual; she
might take on ``the typical beliefs of a Solar'', for example, if she
believes the dominant character to be a Solar. If no suitable individual
exists, take the perceived most dominant social structure or formal
organization of the town, kingdom or similar large grouping in which the
Exalt finds herself. Failing that, _i.e._, if no one society is
dominant, or there is no social grouping nearby, take the inherent
tendencies of the nearest major environmental force, be it an elemental
pole of Creation, the Wyld, or somewhere on the other side of a magical
portal.

When the count of Podge reaches 10 (or more), the character is driven to
act strictly in accordance with the dominant order, again insofar as she
understands it. If both reach or pass 10, the character must support the
dominant order and oppose the next most dominant, or the other way
round--her choice. If the dominant order is an environmental one, the
next most dominant will be the next-nearest environmental one. This
effect lasts one scene, after which both counts reset to zero.

=== Profane Fate

The confusion which comes with the Discordian Exaltation extends to their very
existence in reality. They are not able to wear different destinies as are the
Sidereals but have a single Recumbent Destiny, which enables them to lie low
whenever they wish, which is most of the time. This nature goes beyond the
Sidereals’ Fate-twisting presence--it is not a ``Destiny'' in the sense the
bureaucracies of Yu-Shan would use, so it functions in every realm of Reality,
not only among the strands of Creation’s Loom of Fate. This magic is a Shaping
effect operating on memories and similar physical records, so specifically
targeted Shaping defenses may partly or fully ward against it.

Unlike the Sidereal’s broken-Mask ``blessing'', a Discordian chooses when
to activate her Recumbent Destiny, and does so retroactively. Spending a
point of temporary Willpower activates this effect for a number of
beings up to a Magnitude equal to the character’s Essence, covering any
single scene in the last day (or equivalent time periods in the Wyld and
other realms). The character can spend further points of temporary
Willpower to increase the Magnitude, and to increase the time from which
the effect should start and the retrospective duration as follows. No
more than 5 points can be spent on each, and it is not possible to
choose a duration longer than the onset time, since this power can only
alter memories, not future events.

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|====
|Willpower Points |Onset time
|0 |One day ago
|1 |One week ago
|2 |One month ago
|3 |One season ago
|4 |One year ago

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|====
|Willpower Points |Duration
|0 |One scene or hour
|1 |One day
|2 |One week
|3 |One month
|4 |One season
|5 |One year
|====

The targets must have been observing the character during the selected time
period, though she need not have been aware of their observation for the
effect to apply to them. Thereafter, whenever an affected target wishes to
recall the character--her presence, appearance, actions and so on--he must
roll (Wits + Integrity) at a difficulty 1 but with an internal penalty of -3,
or -(Discordian’s Essence) if greater. A target who is himself a Discordian
gains his Essence in bonus dice, however. The target rolls each time he
attempts to remember until he has made (Discordian’s Essence) successful
rolls. Failure on any roll means the target has forgotten the details of his
observations and makes no further rolls. Similarly, gaining more successes
than the Discordian’s Essence in a single roll means the target has clearly
remembered the details, and need make no more rolls to retain his memories.

Failure to remember does not mean a complete blank in experience, rather
the target will remember some of what happened but with the details
confused--they will be sure that the person’s gender was opposite, or
that there was in fact a group of five or six acting in concert, or that
events which happened in one scene were spread out over several days, or
that they were Lunar rather than Solar. The specifics are up to the
Storyteller but the effect is to make it harder to connect the memories
with reality, making them less likely to connect the Exalt with them,
should they meet again. In a group of witnesses there may be several
distinct groups of slightly different memories, or each person may have
his own recollection.

Certain Backgrounds allow the character to selectively exclude
individuals from a target group. She may also always choose to exclude
specific Essence-users with whom she is acquainted, meaning those with
whom she has interacted for at least a few scenes.

Physical records of the character’s interactions are also subtly tweaked
by this effect. Attempts to track down accurate information about her
using such skills as Bureaucracy, Investigation, and Survival, for
example, have their difficulty increased by (Discordian’s Essence ÷ 2).
Rolls which would have succeeded but for the increased difficulty turn
up misleading or confused information, as per the effect on memories.
Failed rolls simply indicate a normal failure.

Only the memories of the original observers are directly affected so, if
a Discordian waits too long to erase her tracks, hearsay and rumor may
contain some record of her. However, discerning the truth through such
reports is subject to the same increased difficulty as for physical
records.

As well as provoking confusion in witnesses and records, the Recumbent
Destiny offers some protection from the machinations of Yu-Shan. If
someone attempts to locate the character by inspecting the Loom of Fate
within a week of her activating her Recumbent Destiny, she is always
treated as having Essence 1 and, after applying any other modifiers, the
difficulty is multiplied by her (Essence ÷ 2). Furthermore, if the
seeker botches only after accumulating enough successes that he would
have found the character but for this extra multiplier then, rather than
fail to find the character at all, he will incorrectly identify a
different strand as belonging to the character.

=== Backgrounds

==== Standard Backgrounds

All of the standard backgrounds apply to Discordian Exalted, but most
are altered in some way.

===== Allies

Similarly to the Sidereals, the Erisians tend to find it difficult to
gain true allies; not because they are mystically difficult to remember,
but because they prefer to keep their existence and goals quiet.
However, they may align themselves, often temporarily and under false
identities, with those who wish to upset the prevailing ways: raksha on
the borders of Creation, Lunars in the Wyld, rebel slaves in Guild
encampments, Dynasts in the River Province, and so on. In mechanical
terms, at the end of a story (or at any other significant juncture the
storyteller deems appropriate), Erisians may give up any one or more
allies of their choice and re-spend those dots on new allies. Former
allies do not simply disappear, however (well, except for some of the
raksha), and may or may not remain friendly.

To be recognized by allies, the Exalt’s Recumbent Destiny must be
suppressed. This succeeds auto­matically for those who have made this
sort of bond but, as ever, any witnesses will also recognize the
character.

===== Artifact

Given the obscurity in which they have so far labored, Discordian
Exalted have found it harder to come by artifacts of power, and very
difficult to obtain the most powerful without drawing unwanted
attention. The normal rules for Solars apply, with an additional cost at
character creation time: Artifact 4 items cost 5 dots, and Artifact 5
costing 7. Artifacts gained or created during play have the usual
experience cost but, as ever, the most powerful are likely to draw
high-powered attention.

===== Backing

Again due to the need to remain hidden, starting Erisian characters
cannot have a Backing rating of more than 3 in any one organization ...
unless that organization itself is unknown to most people, either
because it is secret (e.g., the Grass Spiders, the Salinan Society) or
because it is based far from any other civilization.

Interacting with a backing organization requires a temporary lifting of
Recumbent Destiny, with the usual implications for being generally
recognized. The normal difficulty is reduced by the effective Backing
rating of the highest-ranking other member of the organization present,
to a minimum of zero.

===== Contacts

Given their propensity for playing off different groups against each
other, the Priests of Eris fare better than average in regard to this
background. Buying dots beyond 3 still only costs 1 bonus point per dot.
Additionally, when rolling to find a minor contact, they may add dice
from any relevant Ability (e.g., Socialize, Bureaucracy, Presence),
including use of Excellencies.

To deal with a contact, the Exalt’s Recumbent Destiny must be
suppressed. This succeeds auto­matically in the presence of major
contacts, but requires a (Wits + Occult) roll for minor ones. While this
obfuscation is lifted, onlookers will also recognize the character.

===== Cult

Members of the Discordian Society are strongly discouraged from having
cults themselves--it being a non-prophet organization--but they may gain
the benefits of this background insofar as they bring others to devoutly
follow some ideal which furthers a disbalancing of order and chaos
appropriate to the situation. If significant numbers of cult members
start to worship the Exalt directly, the effect of the background is as
if it were one dot lower, until they are dissuaded. No starting
character may have the Cult background above 3.

To be recognized by cult members, the Exalt’s Recumbent Destiny must be
suppressed. In the presence of cult members this will succeed
auto­matically but means that, as usual, onlookers will recognize the
character, too.

===== Familiar

This background applies as normal to the Children of Eris. Familiars
always recognize the character, regardless of whether or not the
Recumbent Destiny is in effect.

===== Followers

Discordians seem to be better at founding Cults--or encouraging others to
found their own, just for kicks--than attracting direct followers. This
background provides a fifth of the number of followers that a Solar
Exalt would attract for the same number of dots. However, it also
requires one less dot in Resources, Background or Influence to support
them. Hence a single dot in Followers provides a single loyal sidekick
who is willing and able to pay his or her own way.

Trait Effects: +
|====
|• |Provides a single follower.
|•• |Provides up to 5 followers.
|••• |Provides 20 followers.
|•••• |Provides a loyal band of 100 followers.
|••••• |Provides a small army of 1,000 followers.
|====

The Exalt can choose a group of up to 5 core followers who will
recognize him or her without the need for the Recumbent Destiny to be
suppressed. Beyond that, lifting the obscuration succeeds auto­matically
for followers, but has the usual implication that any onlookers will
also see him or her directly.

===== Influence

Discordians are able to gain influence in society as well as Solar
Exalts, though they usually prefer to do so only with some magical
disguise in effect, since they must lift their Recumbent Destiny in
order to gain fame and exercise their influence, and this lifting is not
automatic.

[[Background_Manse,Manse]]
===== Manse

indexterm:[-,Backgrounds,Manse]The Manse background functions normally for the
Children of Eris. Their tricksome nature some­how includes the peculiar
ability of being able to disentangle themselves from an attunement to a
demesne, unlike other Essence users (<<Exalted>>, p. 27).  Hence they are more
willing to take advantage of these naturally occurring power sources, and
indeed revel in their unpredictability.

===== Mentor

This background applies as normal to the Discordians. Mentors may or may
not know the character’s true nature but, in any case, the bond of
mentorship allows the character to automatically lift the Recumbent
Destiny in the presence of the mentor. As usual, onlookers will also be
unaffected while it is lifted.

===== Resources

This background functions normally for Dis­cordian Exalts. They prefer
sources of income which are hard to track back to them, but that is a
matter of flavor rather than mechanics.

===== Sifu

Discordians can learn Sidereal martial arts, and can having a rating in
this background. However, a starting character cannot have a sifu rated
above three, and had better have a good reason why a Sidereal is
actually willing to teach her. The Sidereal may be a ronin, and
undoubtedly has his own reasons, too.

===== Spies

The Spies background available to Discordians is equivalent in effect to
that which Abyssal Exalted have. However, in this case, the agents in
question are not necessarily part of one network serving a single
master, and usually do not know who the character works for--even
assuming the character knows that. Rather, this background enables a
Priestess of Eris to use certain passwords and signs to gain information
from spies in networks set up by other powers. She gains no special
influence over these organizations but equally she is unlikely to be
treated with suspicion, unless she does something clearly opposed to an
organization, and cannot come up with a convincing subtle reason why. If
a character truly does fall out of favor with a spy network in some
area, the Storyteller may allow her to transfer dots of this Background
to some other area with a little work, and perhaps a reduced experience
cost.

==== Extra Backgrounds

===== Pineal Gland

This background represents the character’s intuitive connection to Eris
herself, through mystical enhancement of an organ placed just above the
eyes in the anatomy of all human beings (and somewhere nearby in other
mortal races, as it happens). As well as contributing to the efficacy of
Numerology actions, this background represents the number of times in a
story that the character may channel the spirit of Eris for aid. Rather
than adding dice to a roll, it enables the character to get a hint from
Eris (i.e., gets the player a hint from the storyteller) as to the best
action to take, in the immediate circumstances, to support his or her
Motivation. This advice may be cryptic, short-sighted, or otherwise a
mixed blessing, but it will be at least slightly helpful. The
Storyteller rolls the character’s (Wits + Pineal Gland) and the number
of successes determines the usefulness of the result, with a botch
resulting in some actively misleading information. Accessing the pineal
gland in this manner is a miscellaneous action. Using up ``channels'' of
this Background during a story does not reduce its value in Numerology
actions.

===== Echoes

Discordian Exaltations do not get recycled through Lytek’s cabinet and
research so far points to few, if any, of them being around during the
First Age. The experience of Erisian Exaltation does not include a flood
of memories of the past, so it’s not even certain that the Exaltations
persist between multiple hosts. This lack of connection to the past can
put Discordians at some disadvantage compared to other types of Exalts,
and cause problems when trying to pass as one of them. Eris is skilled
in appropriating others’ ideas, however, and has given her Children a
way to tap into ancient wisdom (or ancient foolishness, as the case may
be).

Each point in this background allows the character to access fragments
of the memories of a single now-deceased Exalt of any type, including
another Discordian, or any kind of being for which a Parametadivision
exists. The memories will cover only a single lifetime and may or may
not match those memories which, for instance, Lytek would have chosen.
The player must choose the identity and lifetime of the Echoed character
when the background is purchased, and record suitable Motivation and
Intimacies. It cannot be purchased more than once for a given past life.

By spending a point of Willpower reflexively, the character can adjust
his Essence signature to precisely match that of the echoed Exaltation
for a single scene, provided his current apparent anima and Essence type
matches. This faking of identity might allow the character to, for
instance, activate an individually-keyed First Age artifact, or pass as
a particular Sidereal with increased confidence. If by some chance the
current bearer either of that Exaltation (or soul, in the case of
Parametadivisions which do not mimic Exalts) comes within (bearer’s
Essence x 10) yards, that other will feel strangely drawn to the
Discordian, able to locate him except through the strongest of magical
barriers, yet will feel uncomfortable in his presence. Detailed Essence
sight or similar Charms may reveal the Echoing. Certain other very
powerful mimicry effects, such as the Ebon Dragon’s Black Mirror
Shintai, may also trigger this resonance.

Additionally, a number of times per session equal to his Essence, the
character can add one die to any dice pool for each of the Echoed beings
which might have had some relevant knowledge or skill (as adjudicated by
the Storyteller). If the number of successes on this roll exceeds the
character’s Dodge MDV, the Echoes from the past overwhelm the character
and he finds himself unavoidably compelled to act in accordance with the
Motivation and Intimacies of one of those past lives for one scene, as
if subject to an overflowing of Hodge. On the other hand, if the roll is
botched, the character is underwhelmed with the wisdom he receives and
is compelled to act against that past life, as with an overflow of
Podge. Neither of these conditions actually affects the character’s
Hodge or Podge tracks. If the character is subject to an overflow of
Hodge or Podge in the same scene where Echoes have already overtaken
him, the overflowing tracks are reset but the effects are delayed until
the start of the next scene.

=== Erisian Elements

All who live in or near Creation are aware of the five Elements which
define it. Those with long memories and arcane knowledge are aware of at
least one other, vitriol--not to mention those which permeate the body of
Autochthon. The Chosen of Eris, however, have been given a glimpse of
the extent to which the set of elements is as much part of the
imagination as of reality. The Bringers of Confusion each have power
over an element not normally seen in Creation--not because it is absent,
but simply because it is not perceived as such.

The Priests of Disruption are able to exercise powers of Erisian
Elemental Expression (as an Occult Charm) and Erisian Elemental
Rejuvenation (as a Resistance Charm), similar to those available to
elementals (Exalted, p. 302). They work only with the element matching
their Parametadivision. In addition, if they have the ability to summon
elementals, they may choose to summon those normally resident in
Creation or, if conditions are suitable, conjure up a representative of
any of the elements which Eris has made visible to her followers. Since
there is little belief on the part of mortals in these things being
elements, the elementals which manifest them will rarely reach an
Essence of 3, and never greater than 4--at least, not without radical
changes to Creation (or expansion into the Wyld).

The purview of each elemental type is as follows.

*Orange:* Anything colored more-or-less orange--fruit such as oranges and
peaches; sunrises and sunsets; glowing embers; fading leaves; various
creatures, from cats to demons.

*Sweet:* The literal sensation of food and drink, plus some other things
pleasurable and energizing--fruits such as strawberries and peaches; new
love, and old; the glow after love-making; fitting revenge; religious
ecstasy.

*Boom:* Explosions from various sources--burning or mixing certain
unstable materials; rapid changes in or releases of pressure; sudden
anger; riots and fierce battles; accidents with demesnes and manses.

*Pungent:* Strong smells and tastes, hard to conceal--lilies, incense,
rich wine; rotting meat, truffles, strong cheese; body odor; fervor,
sexual vigor or deviance, bigotry; blatant lies; great art and beauty.

*Prickle:* Unease, physical or otherwise--uncomfortable furniture; the
sense of being watched; the feeling of being about to cough or sneeze;
``pins and needles'' in a limb; mild but persistent harassment;
unnecessary rules.

*Dirt:* Distasteful things, or things where they are not wanted--earth,
dust, stains; manure, decayed plant matter, corpses, zombies; invaders,
refugees, the homeless; natural disarray; disgust, crude comments;
scandal, slander and gossip.

*Focus:* Unwavering attention to a person, activity, idea etc.--devotion,
worship, zeal; idealistic love or incurable hatred; dedication to a
profession, masterful construction; meditation, trance.

*Dream:* Unreal things brought to mind--the stories and fears of sleep,
natural or otherwise; hopes, aspirations and goals; unattainable
perfection, frustration; daydreams, distraction, withdrawal from
reality.

*Binding:* Things constrained, externally or by their natural
relationships--imprisonment, slavery, cultism, allegiance; marriage,
family ties, debts and oaths; canals, cement, manacles, retaining walls,
ripening fruit.

Exactly which locations or experiences count as sufficiently ``raw'' as to
be usable for Elemental Rejuvenation is left to the storyteller’s
discretion. The orange anima of the Anchor Division is only powerful
enough during those actions on which it flares to its full glory. The
Indivisibles are likely to heal surprisingly quickly overnight; members
of the Division by Zero have been known to carry boxes of earth around
to sleep in; and those in the Sub-Division bound by a particularly
onerous oath sanctified by an Eclipse-caste Solar might find it has some
peculiar side-effects.
