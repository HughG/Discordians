[[Chapter_4_Charms]]
== Charms

Quite what is the source of Discordians' Charms is as much a mystery as the
identity of Eris herself.  They are based on the typical learned Abilities of
mortals, so at first glance would not appear to be drawn from the panoply of
some Primordial power.  However, each tree includes Charms which stretch the
bounds of applicability into feats which may seem only vaguely or
metaphorically related to the Ability which underlies them.  Regardless, Eris'
chosen wield these powers with ease and glee to bring discord in her name.
They are also perhaps more prone that other Exalted to invent Charms of their
own, to keep everyone guessing.

indexterm:[-, Mimicry, Cosmetic Charm]Discordian Exalted are not able to learn
the Charms of other Exalted, though other Exalted who can learn ``foreign''
Charms, such as Eclipse Caste Solars, may learn Discordian ones.  However,
Discordians can automatically and freely change the Obvious aspects of their
Charms to mimic other Charm effects theyâ€™ve witnessed or heard of--from
Exalted, gods, demons, or other magical beings--as long as they are at least
as Obvious.  If an onlooker is attempting to discern the exact identity of a
Discordian Charm in use, and the character is attempting to disguise it as a
paritculary Charm belonging to some other Exalt type, a contested roll against
the character's (Essence &#x2B; Ability) is required to see the truth.

.Design Note: Charm Themes and Mechanisms
****

To help you see some coherence in the Discordian's strange mix of Charms, and
to give you ideas for designing your own, a mention of some of the common
principles behind them seems in order--though that may be an illusion.

Common themes in these Charms include confusion, interference, cheating and
other rule-bending, improvisation, reinterpretation, reconstruction, reversal,
and transcendence.

Mechanics which are often employed include Elsewhere (because, hey, nobody
else is using it much ... and because Eris Discordia is in Limbo), unnatural
mental influence, Intimacies and Motivations, stunts, Shaping, plus a
sprinkling of Charms which change the way certain traits and rules work.

Some design thought has been given to the structure of Charm trees for the
Children of Eris.  They must regularly confront--nay, become!--the unexpected
and unknowable, so they tend more to generalism than specialism.  This affects
their Charm tree structures in two ways.  Firstly, most Charms in each tree
are accessible without Excellencies, with them serving as prerequisites for
the more powerful and unique Charms for a given Ability.  Secondly, those
niche Charms tend to include ones which stretch the boundaries of the meaning
of an Ability, so that characters who invest heavily in an Ability can gain
some facility in areas which might seem unrelated.

=== General Charms

==== Excellencies and Related Charms

indexterm:[-, Charms, Excellencies and Insolencies]Just like the other
Exalted, Eris' Chosen have some general-purpose Charms which apply to many
kinds of actions.  Discordian Excellencies can be learned in relation to any
Ability, though there is some extra flexibility in how they are used.  The
number of dice which can be added by a Discordian Excellency, or any other
dice-adding Charm, is (Ability + stunt rating) dice.

.Discordian Flaws of Invulnerability
@@@@

In order to survive the vagaries of the world--and, indeed, the consequences
of their own mischief--Eris' Children are equipped with perfect defence Charms
on a par with the other Celestial Exalted.  They are subject to Flaws of
Invulnerability but for Discordians these are aligned not to the four Virtues
but to the five Divisions.  Each such Charm must be associated with a
particular Flaw when a character purchases it.  The character may choose any
Flaw, not only that of his own Division, but may have at most two different
Flaws across all perfect defence Charms he knows.  At Essence 5&#x2B; he may
increase this to a maximum of three different Flaws.  The character may select
a different Flaw if un-learning and re-learning a Charm during
<<Divisional_Realignment>>.

_1st Flaw_: Knowing the oneness of all things, the character cannot bring
himself to directly harm his attacker until his DV refreshes twice.  Harm
includes any unwanted alteration to traits, or damage to possessions on the
opponent's person.  He may restrain, distract or otherwise interfere with his
opponent, and may allow harm to befall the opponent from other sources.  If
the character defends against attacks from multiple opponents before his DV
refreshes twice, this stricture applies against each.

_2nd Flaw_: Being drawn toward those who are drawn to her, the character is
compelled to use subsequent actions to target her attacker until her DV
refreshes twice.  If the opponent is not a valid target on any such action,
the character may act as she chooses.  If the character defends against
attacks from multiple opponents before his DV refreshes twice, she may pick
any one of them on each attack.

_3rd Flaw_: Understanding his responsibilities to others, the character finds
he cannot attend only to his own defense, and must use any further actions to
help any of his own allies, be they joined in battle or bystanders, until his
DV refreshes twice.  Help must take the form of defending one or more allies,
or joining in a coordinated attack of their choosing.  He must help with
actions relating to the opponent against which he defended, in preference to
any other applicable actions, if given a choice.  If the character defends
against attacks from multiple opponents before his DV refreshes twice, he may
prefer any one of them on each helpful action.

_4th Flaw_: Connected subliminally to awarenesses around her, the character's
focused opposition inadvertently gives her attacker insight into her actions
in the moment before she takes them.  Her opponent chooses one of two
benefits, which lasts until her DV refreshes twice: either &#x2B;3 to each
attack against the character as if awarded by an Aim action, or &#x2B;3 to his
DVs against attacks made by the character.  If the character defends against
attacks from multiple opponents before her DV refreshes twice, each of them
benefits in this way.  If the character defends against the same opponent
multiple times before her DV refreshes twice, the same bonus continues to
apply, and does not stack.

_5th Flaw_: When the character uses a Charm with this Flaw to defend against
an opponent's attacks, he effectively concedes authority to his opponent by
going entirely on the defensive.  Until his DV refreshes twice, he cannot act
until at least the tick after his opponent's next action, although he can
defend as normal, and counterattack.  If the opponent becomes Inactive, leaves
combat, or the Storyteller otherwise decides he has no prospect of acting, the
restriction of this flaw ends.  If the character defends against attacks from
multiple opponents before, each of them must take one action before the
character can act, and this waiting game happens at least twice.  If an
opponent simply chooses to Guard on his action tick, that still counts as an
action, allowing the character to then take his turn.  If the character would
otherwise act more than one tick after the opponent's next action, he must
wait until that tick as usual.

=== Martial Arts

A Discordian Exalt is capable of learning Terrestrial, Celestial, and even
Sidereal Martial Arts, though persuading a Sifu to teach her the latter, or
tricking him or her into it, may not be entirely straightforward.  They do not
have their own Hero style, but some of their Martial Arts Charms allow them to
take on some of the power unique to other Exalted, at a price.  They do,
however, have at least one signature style which they claim to have introduced
to Creation.
