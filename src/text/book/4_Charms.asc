== Charms

(TODO: ``Celestial Spanner Xxx''?)

Discordian Exalted are not able to learn the Charms of other Exalted,
though other Exalted who can learn ``foreign'' Charms, such as Zenith
Caste Solars, may learn Discordian ones. However, Discordians can
automatically change the Obvious aspects of their Charms to mimic other
Charm effects they’ve witnessed or heard of, as long as they are at
least as Obvious. Also, they are quite capable of developing custom
Charms at least equivalent in power to the Sidereals, if not quite the
Solars. Indeed, they’re encouraged to do so, to keep their opponents
guessing.

=== Excellencies

The First (Ability) Excellency, Essence Overwhelming: 1m adds 1 die to
pool, up to a maximum of (Ability + stunt rating) motes. With a suitable
stunt and a surcharge, can be used to enhance an action using any
_other_ Ability. The action cannot involve activation of Charms from the
other Ability, though it may involve the effects of Permanent Charms or
those which are not counted as a Charm activation. The surcharge is 2m
for an Ability in a neighboring Division, or 4m for the other two
Divisions.

The Second (Ability) Excellency, Essence Triumphant: 2m adds 1 success,
up to a maximum of (Ability + stunt rating) motes. With a suitable
stunt, this Excellency can be used with other Abilities in the same
manner as the First Excellency.

The Third (Ability) Excellency, Essence Revisited (Step 7 / reroll): 2m adds
(Ability ÷ 2) automatic successes to the roll, or increases a static value by
a like amount.  However, the next non-trivial use of that ability is subject
to an equal external penalty.  The Storyteller is free to decide what
constitutes an important use--the intent is to prevent a player freeing a
character from this looming penalty by taking some irrelevant action such as
tying a shoelace.

The Other (Ability) Excellency, Essence Discounted: each 2m reduces the
cost of the first three Excellencies by 1m for one scene, to a minimum
of 0, with a maximum reduction of the character’s permanent Essence.

(TODO: The following one needs reviewing for game balance.)

The First? (Ability) Insolency, Essence Confounding (Step 7?): 4m forces
opponent to re-roll and choose less desirable result. If the opponent applies
the Essence Resurgent in the same action (regardless of the step [does that
make sense?]), this Excellency costs 2m, and neither character’s Excellency
comes into effect, with the opponent’s motes remaining unspent.

The Second? (Ability) Insolency, Essence Ominous: each 4m raises target
number for opponent by 1, up to a maximum of 9. At the same time, the
target can’t botch: they always get at least 1 success. This Charm can
only be applied against actions which affect the character directly, be
it individually or as part of a group.

Another? (Ability) Insolency, Essence Rebalanced: 1m per die, up to the number
of Excellency dice the opponent bought, counting automatic successes as two
dice.

=== Martial Arts

[TODO ... not sure I can be bothered with these, except maybe the
Bureaucracy-related one :-)]

The forms which are native to Discordian Exalted are of the Celestial
level. They are capable of learning Sidereal Martial Arts, but
persuading a suitable master to provide instruction, or tricking him or
her into it, may not be entirely straightforward.
