== Numerology and Other Magics

=== Numerology

The Disciples of Indiscipline do not have access to the Loom of Fate and
the pattern spiders, as the Sidereals do, but their mysterious
benefactor has provided them with an alternative way to mess around with
the details of existence. Erisian Numerology is based on an intuitive
understanding of and direct interference with the structure of reality,
mediated by the pineal gland. As such, it is more limited in scope and
duration than Astrology but perhaps more flexible, and able to operate
outside Fate. It functions equally well in Creation, Yu-Shan, Malfeas,
the Underworld and Autochthonia. It even works in the Wyld, although the
Shaping abilities of the raksha make them more likely to be able to
counter its effects.

Numerology is also carefully balanced to avoid attracting the wrath of the
pattern spiders, when operating within Fate, and the Design Weavers of
Autochthonia.  That’s not to say that they won’t notice at all, but there is
no build-up of Paradox for Discordians. Similarly, working Numerology does not
count as a ``fate-altering act'' in terms of making it easier for Sidereals to
find the character in the Loom of Fate--it _may_ alter Fate, but stitches up
the results sufficiently well to avoid notice. The effects are achieved by
sheer force of Eristic will, avoiding the need to manipulate Essence flows
directly. This means that, while many Charms can be duplicated to some extent,
the cost is in some ways higher, and the effects double-edged.

This section is almost certainly full of game-ruining imbalances, and
even unfairness between Divisions, so it’ll need some thought and
play-testing.

==== Working the Numbers

To apply a Numerological effect, an Erisian Exalt must take the
following steps.

* Determine his Numerology point total for the effect.
* Choose a duration, range and scope, and a specific target fitting that
scope.
* Choose one or more values to be affected.
* Select a mechanism of balance for the effect.
* Take a miscellaneous action (Speed 5, DV -2) and spend one or more
points of temporary Willpower.

A character can sustain at most (Essence) concurrent Numerology effects.
An effect is not considered to have ended until its balance has been
paid off (see <<Numerology_Balance>>).

An Erisian has (Essence + Pineal Gland) points to spend on any
Numerological effect. Thus buying up the Pineal Gland background is the
easiest way to increase one’s power in this arena. Points are spent as
described in the following sections.

==== Duration

The duration of the effect is always at least one action, and can be
increased by spending Numerology points, as follows.

[options="header"]
|====
|Numerology Points |Duration
|0 |One action
|1 |One scene or hour
|2 |One day
|3 |One week
|4 |One month
|5 |One season
|====

No more than 5 points can be spent on increasing the duration.

==== Range

By default the Numerologist must touch her target to affect it, but the
range can be extended by spending more points.

[options="header"]
|====
|Numerology Points |Range
|0 |Touch
|1 |5 yards
|2 |50 yards
|3 |500 yards
|4 |5 miles
|5 |50 miles
|====

==== Scope

The scope of the effect, similarly, is always at least one individual
creature or object. For creatures, the number of points here equates to
the Magnitude of the unit affected. For objects, take the number of
humans in a unit of that Magnitude, standing in close formation, and use
that as rough guide to the volume which can be affected--approximately 2
cubic yards each. The effect can be worked on only part of a larger
object, e.g., to weaken part of a wall, but it can only affect multiple
objects if they are substantially the same and all within the affected
volume, e.g., several small huts. The effect cannot be applied to
several different kinds of objects within a given volume, just as it
cannot be applied to several different social or military groups in a
given area. It can be applied to a general volume of space, as long as
it contains mostly the same substance, e.g., air, or water. As with
duration, the maximum number of points which can be spent here is five.

==== Target

Having chosen the scope of the effect, the character must nominate a
specific target. If that target is an Essence-wielder with Essence
greater than the Discordian, there will be an additional cost for each
point of difference between the target’s essence and his own. This cost
may be paid in Numerology points (sacrificing some aspects of the
overall effect), temporary Willpower points, or some combination. If the
difference is more than 5, the effect will automatically fail. Without
advance knowledge of the target’s Essence (e.g., through performing a
Numerological Assay as described below), the character will not discover
this cost until she has committed to the Numerology action.

Targeting characters with lesser Essence does not give any bonuses. A
worker of Numerology may choose himself as the target of an effect, but
must of course take on the consequences of Balance.

==== Affected Values

After spending points on duration, range and scope, the remaining points
are spent to increase or decrease various values. Each value may be
modified only once in a given effect, and only by one point. The cost of
modifying a given value depends on the underlying Division to which the
Priest of Eris belongs: those listed below under his own Division cost 1
point each; those in neighboring Divisions (assuming 1 and 5 are
neighboring) cost 2, and those in the remaining Divisions cost 3. The
character may choose not to spend some of these remaining points.

Any Attribute, Ability or Virtue may be modified, though the costs vary
depending on the character’s Division. None may be raised above 5;
Abilities cannot be lowered below 0, Attributes and Virtues below 1.

===== 1st Division

In addition to their Divisional Abilities, the Anchorites favor modifying
Stamina, Appearance, Perception and Conviction.  They also favor modify the
effects of poisons and sources of environmental trauma, divided into the
following aspects:

* damage value
* damage type (B/L/A)
* damage interval (action, minute, day, hour)
* toxicity value
* toxicity tag (M/-/L)

Note that substances which are not already harmful cannot be made so,
since there could be no Balance to such a change. A poison may be
rendered temporarily harmless through Numerology, but its effects will
be applied when the Numerology ends, unless it has been expelled from
the victim’s system.

A target’s penalties with regard to low visibility situations fall under this
Division's purview. The aspects which can be changed are:

* relevant distances: a distance of 0 can be raised to 10 yards, or a
distance of 10 yards or less reduced to 0; other distances can be
multiplied or divided by 10
* the external penalty itself (by default -1 for poor visibility, -2 for
none)

The above effects can either apply to the prevailing conditions within a
volume of space (taking that ``object'' as the effect’s target), to a
volume of some substance (such as or to all individuals within the scope
(who may then move elsewhere but still be affected). These changes
affect the abilities of those affected (or those who wander into the
affected area), rather than the amount of light in an area, which may be
a rather strange experience.

Lastly, they may modify the effective permanent Essence of a target. This does
not change mote pools or availability of Charms, Sorcery and so on, since
those are static calculations. However, it may change the effects of Charms
later used by or applied to the target. For example, a Solar archer who had
her effective Essence rating reduced from 3 to 2 would no longer be able to
activate the effect of There Is No Wind which allows her to increase her
weapon Range to her maximum visibility; similarly, she would only be able to
buy up to 3 extra attacks with Trance of Unhesitating Speed. She would still
be able to use Accuracy Without Distance (Essence minimum 3) if she had
learned it, though. In particular, this change _does_ affect the potential
extra cost for other characters subsequently applying Numerology to a target
with greater Essence.

===== 2nd Division

The manipulations which come most easily to the Matchmakers are their
Divisional Abilities, Charisma, Manipulation, Stamina, Compassion, and the
following.

They may increase or decrease the Control rating for animals, vehicles,
automata etc.

They may adjust the number of Intimacies an individual has, causing him or her
to temporarily forget one, one or gain one of the character’s choice, as long
as it does not strongly conflict with an existing Intimacy.

They may modify either the effective permanent Willpower rating of the
target, or the number of points of temporary Willpower. If the permanent
total is changed, the current temporary value does not immediately
change in line. For social units, this affects Loyalty.

===== 3rd Division

The basic traits favored by this Division, beyond their own Abilities, are
Charisma, Strength, Wits, and Valor.  The warriors of the Apple Corps are,
unsurprisingly, most skilled in influencing what happens in the thick of
battle. They favor modifying the following values for all kinds of creature
(excluding automata, unless they somehow possess life, e.g., God-Striders).

* Join Battle/Debate _and_ DV/MDV for unexpected attacks (both modified
together)
* Dodge or Parry DV
* Dodge or Parry MDV
* Knockdown Threshold _and_ Pool (both modified together)
* Stunning Threshold _and_ Pool (both modified together)
* Natural soak value, across all types of damage – this implies that
increasing this value will allow even mortals to soak at least one level
of lethal and of aggravated damage, while also increasing their bashing
soak. Soak for each type cannot be reduced below 0.
* Number of -4 Health levels – if reduced to no -4 Health levels,
further reductions take away Incapacitated levels, then Dying levels.

These Erisians are also adept at modifying those weapons which are used
by a single individual (as opposed to large-scale weapons which require
a team of operators). Each of the statistics of a weapon or item of
armor may be adjusted individually, with Range being doubled or halved,
the rest (including ability minimums and attunement costs) being
adjusted by a single point. One weapon tag may also be added or removed,
if it remotely makes sense to do so; e.g., adding the S tag to the
target’s daiklave, so that it requires a miscellaneous action to
``reload'' after each attack; or removing the ``F'' tag from a flame piece,
so that it can only be used as a short club. Storyteller discretion is
required here.

They can also, if in a more peaceful mood, modify the Magnitude of a
social unit (except bureaucracies, which are favored by the 5th
Division). Any gains or losses in numbers must be made up of beings with
an Essence rating (or, in the unlikely case of sociable automata,
Artifact rating) no more than half the character’s own Essence, rounded
_down_. Where do these people come from (or go to)? Best not to ask ...

===== 4th Division

Alongside their Divisional Abilities, They Who Stand in The Doorway favor
Dexterity, Wits and Manipulation.

For Charms or Sorcery effects which have a duration other than Instant
or Indefinite, the Unhinged can increase or decrease the duration. They
are able to change the value but not the order of magnitude, e.g.,
extend one scene to two, but not to one day. The effect must be one
which has already begun, so fortunate timing is required to be able to
apply this to effects which last only one action. A duration of one
scene can be reduced, causing the effect to cut out at some
storyteller-selected point during the scene. A duration of one action
can be reduced, causing the effect to end on the tick after the
Numerology action. Durations of literal time periods, e.g., 5 minutes,
can always be changed.

Additionally, the Gatekeepers are able to alter the benefits a character
receives through his Backgrounds. Some storyteller interpretation is needed
here: gaining a point in the Artifact Background does not modify existing
artifacts, or cause a new short daiklave to appear instantly on the target’s
person, but it may make them likely to stumble on one within the
duration. Similarly, reducing the Artifact background will not cause the
target to immediately lose attunement to one of their artifacts but they may
``soon'' temporarily lose one, or some Magitech device may partly
malfunction. For Backgrounds such as Allies, Contacts and so on, the target
may gain or lose favor with these people or groups, while the Numerology is in
effect. The Numerologist is able to choose which Background is affected, but
not which particular Artifact, Ally and so on.

===== 5th Division

The Attributes of Strength, Intelligence and Perception fall under the hand of
the Unbending Arm, along with Temperance and, of course, their Divisional
Attributes.

More suited to the large-scale organization of the battlefield than the fury
of close combat, the Overseers have a knack for influencing large
battles. They are good at modifying the mass combat values of Drill, Might,
Armor, Morale, Speed (in terms of base movement rate) or even Magnitude of a
unit, and can also adjust the number of Heroes, Sorcerers or Relays available
to it. This applies to only one unit: if the unit splits, only one part
retains the benefits; but the effects stay with the unit regardless of how
small or large it subsequently becomes.

They may adjust the number of Intimacies (Policies) a social unit has,
causing them to temporarily forget one, or gain one of the character’s
choice, as long as it does not strongly conflict with an existing
Policy. They can also adjust the Magnitude of a social unit _if_ it is a
bureaucracy of some description.

Another aspect of their rigid nature makes them skilled in changing the
properties of inanimate objects (including all kinds of automata). For
simple objects, they can adjust the following.

* Damaged/Destroyed health levels, to half or double their original
rating.
* Soak (and therefore Hardness), again halved or doubled in each
category--meaning objects will not gain aggravated soak unless they
already had it.

For automata, the same set of values can be modified as 3rd Division
Discordians apply to living beings, plus the automaton virtues of
Reception, Transmission, Stability and Power, if applicable.

For basic artifacts, the Repair rating may be adjusted. For First Age
vehicles, they may also adjust the following.

* Vehicle speed (halve or double)
* Endurance (either halving or doubling the Essence commitment, where
provided by the pilot; or else halving or doubling the time until
maintenance checks are required _or_ the time between checks thereafter)
* Maneuverability
* Crew
* Cargo (halve or double)
* Armor
* Critical Damage Health Levels

(TODO: Maybe give this Division more once Masters of Jade comes out.)

[[Numerology_Balance]]
==== Balance

In order to keep Eris happy, or at least to keep her amused, each
Numerological effect must incorporate an element of balance. The
character must choose one of the following.

* Numerically opposite changes affect one of the target’s allies, if it
is a being or unit, or an adjacent object or area, if not. This other
target is chosen by the storyteller, at the same time. It must be of a
roughly equivalent power rating; e.g., if the target is a group of
extras, the balance affects an equivalent group of extras; if an Essence
user, the balance affects an Essence user of within +/-1 Essence. If the
storyteller determines that there is no such applicable target within
range, this form of Balance cannot be used. The other target may
separately resist the Shaping effect of this balance, if it is capable
of doing so.
* After spending points on duration, range and scope, only half of the
remaining points, rounded up, are spent on modifying values. An equal
number are then spent on the same target by the storyteller, making
whatever adjustments he or she sees fit. Because these are part of the
same effect, the storyteller cannot adjust any of the values chosen by
the character, in the opposite direction – each value may be changed
only once per effect.
* Numerically opposite changes affect the target for an equal duration,
after the initial effect has ended. This may seem like the easy option,
if the Numerologist can arrange to be absent when this happens, but an
inventive storyteller will ensure that’s not true: the target might use
them to track her down and take revenge, or just generally gain
advantage for himself.
* Any other suitable method of balance agreed with the storyteller.

==== Activation

Once the effect has been determined, it can be activated. It costs one
point of temporary Willpower, plus any additional points spent due to
the target having a higher Essence than the character.

If the range is Touch then the target can apply Dodge or Parry DV to
avoid being touched, in which case the effect fails though the Willpower
is still spent. If, in addition, the effect targets more than one being
or object, then all must be successfully touched (or otherwise in range)
for the effect to occur. The duration of the effect begins as soon as
the first is touched, but the adjustments do not apply until the last is
touched.

If the targets are beings with Willpower, and all are successfully
touched, or otherwise in range, they may be able to spend Willpower to
avoid or reduce the effects. Groups of extras and other creatures with
Essence 1 resist as a unit, using the highest Willpower in the group.
Beings with Essence 2+ resist individually, using their own Willpower.
Each can spend one point of temporary Willpower _per modified value_ to
avoid the change to that particular value, if they have no other
applicable defense. Unless the target is willing, this action counts as
an attack, so defensive Charms, counterattacks and so on may come into
play.

==== Numerological Assays

With all these options, it may be hard for a character to decide just
how best to mess around with an opponent. To help with this a little,
the character may perform a Numerological Assay before hand.

In combat situations, this is an action with Speed 3, DV -1, similar to
an Aim action. Outside combat it is an unrolled dramatic action. The
character must propose a particular effect in detail, and they will
learn

* which, if any, of the adjustments would be meaningless (e.g., trying
to increase an Ability which is already at 5);
* whether the character is one point away from Limit Break or similar
effects;
* the amount by which the target’s Essence exceeds the character’s--i.e., the
extra cost required in effect points or Willpower;
* whether the target is already under the effects of Numerology and, if
so, the exact details of that effect.

They will not learn whether some other effect might be more
advantageous.

==== Other Factors

Numerology is a Shaping effect, so Charms such as the Solars’
Integrity-Protecting Prana may apply against it. If the effect is undone
some time after it began (e.g., through the use of an Order Affirming
Blow) and the Balance effect is one which occurs after the original
effect, Balance still applies (and may be separately countered).

Numerology doesn’t count as Charm use, so a character can save his Charm use
in a given action for, say, reflexive defense Charms. This also means it can’t
be used in a Combo with Charms, although it can of course be used in a
flurry. Conceivably some Charms could supplement or otherwise alter the
working of a Numerological effect but, since it isn’t based on an Attribute or
Ability, those cases will be rare.

A single target cannot be the subject of more than one Numerological
effect from the same character at the same time (nor, indeed, until the
Balance effects have played out). Effects from different characters may
stack, but a single trait or other factor cannot be altered by more than
one concurrent Numerology effect. For example, a target can be forced to
gain or lose at most one Intimacy through Numerology, no matter how many
Discordians gang up on him.

=== Sorcery

*[TODO: Fluff about Sorcery]*

==== Triangular Circle

[[Sorcery_Triangular_tgn]]
===== Tweaking Gaia's Nodes
[role="noindent"]
indexterm:[spell, Tweaking Gaia's Nodes (Triangular)]*Cost:* 20m +
*Target:* Demesne

In the First Age this spell most likely had a more arcane-sounding name, or at
least a more respectful one.  It fell out of favor with the invention of Raise
the Puissant Sanctum (<<BoS2WT>>, p. 79), and after the Usurpation the
Terrestrial Exalted had forgotten it.  It has been rediscovered and renamed by
the Children of Eris, who find it more useful due to their ability to unattune
themselves from demesnes (see <<Background_Manse>>).  It allows a sorcerer to
alter the ways in which the Essence of a demesne manifests, without having to
build a manse upon it.

To cast this spell, a sorceror must be attuned to the demesne she wishes to
alter.  For a number of days equal to the demesne's rating, she must walk its
extent, focusing on ignoring those features which do not correspond to the
effects she wants to create, and attending to or envisioning others which
align with them.  Sleeping, even her dreams will echo the new world she sees,
and she is unable to regain Willpower each morning by rolling Conviction
during this time, as her will is bent to the spell.  Any unattuned Essence
users who enter the demesne during this period will disrupt the preparations,
preventing the spell from being cast unless the ritual is begun again.

This period of perambulation complete, the sorceror casts the spell and a
rushing of demense-aspected Essence gathers from all its corners, swirls
around and through her, and washes back out across the land, all in a handful
of seconds.  This display is Obvious to those within the demesne but,
strangely, invisible to those outside, unless they observe it with Essence
sight.

The spell cannot change the demesne's level or aspect, but all other magical
properties--manifestations of Essence within the demesne, Mutations it
eventually inflicts on residents, the nature of its Essence tokens, and the
two-edged benefits it grants to those attuned to it--may be changed
arbitrarily by the caster, or left as they were, provided they remain in theme
for its aspect.  The landscape may also change to some extent, though the
storyteller controls this, rather than the caster, and this will rarely be
Obvious enough to be noticed by anyone who is more than 100 yards outside the
demesne's boundaries.

Any co-attuned beings will notice the impending changes during the spell's
preparation, though they are not automatically able to identify the source,
and cannot counter it without locating the sorceror and disrupting the spell.
Once it is cast, countermagic will not undo its effects.


==== Square Circle

[[Sorcery_Square_www]]
===== Worlds Within Worlds
[role="noindent"]
indexterm:[spell, Worlds Within Worlds (Square)]*Cost:* 25m +
*Target:* Area

[*TODO:* Creates a space which is overlapped on normal space, within a given
area, using fractal folds of Elsewhere.  (Essence) portals are created which
anyone(?) may use to pass into the hidden world.  No physical or immaterial
interaction between the worlds, but those within can see and hear out--and
therefore may be inadvertently targeted by area or group effects which reach
all who can see or hear something.  Those outside will see occasional flickers
of grey in their peripheral vision, on a successful (Perception + Awareness)
roll at a difficulty equal to the caster's [(Essence x 2) - 3](?).  Good for
hiding and spying.  Objects can be taken inside, provided they fit through the
portals.

This inner world can be dispelled by the caster at will, or by others using
countermagic.  In either case, all beings and objects within are immediately
expelled into a nearby location in the embedding world, possibly suffering or
causing various amounts of damage, as determined by the storyteller.
