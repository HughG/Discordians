== Storytelling

[quote, Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst]
``How Discordianism will change you is not, however, the real question.
Anybody can be changed by something they read. No wit, imagination,
creativity, talent or energy is required for that much. How will you
change the Discordian Society is the real question ...''

*[TODO: Maybe some of the stuff in my ``Eris'' or ``Character Creation''
chapters should move here, or vice versa.]*

All the books which establish canon <<Exalted>> types contain a chapter full
of hints and suggestions for running a game which includes them.  You have
arrived at the equivalent for the Discordian Exalted. Although the Children of
Eris are similar in many ways to the various kinds of Celestial Exalted, they
are quite different characters: they don’t really know the source of their
power, they don’t fit into the established history of Creation or the groups
which threaten it, and they aren’t necessarily heroes or villains. What, then,
will they choose to do, and who will they choose to be?

=== Getting Started

All the usual guidelines for running and playing in <<Exalted>> games apply to
this book: have fun; if you don’t like it, change it; and be ready to
compromise and synthesize between Storyteller and player ideas.

If you just want to have Discordians as antagonists to the player
characters, you don’t necessarily have discuss it with them in advance.
But if one or more players want in on the action, you should all think
about what you want to get out of the game. Perhaps you just want to see
what the Erisians are capable of. Maybe you want to have fun, or explore
philosophical questions, through playing super-powered beings who are
part enlightened mystics, but mostly just ordinary folks with no
particular standing, instead of heroes or villains. Perhaps you as the
storyteller have your own idea of who or what Eris is, or why the
Discordians have come to be; the ``Hidden Agenda'' style sees the
characters focus on this, but it could be a significant strand in any
style of game.

=== Game Styles

Most of the typical *Exalted* game styles are applicable to Discordian
characters, as described below. Following that are some suggestions for
other styles which particularly suit them.

==== Styles Remix

``Vanilla Exalted'' is perhaps the hardest style to play, because the
existence of the Erisians has only been known for certain for the last several
hundred years. Even then, only a very few Exalts and gods know about them,
mainly those obsessed with matters occult or secretive, hence any claims they
might make are rarely believed. Certainly the Children of Eris will be pursued
as Anathema by the Wyld Hunt, if they can find them, and the Abyssals will try
to kill them, but the reactions of other powerful beings are hard to
predict. For the characters themselves, they have no archetype to follow, only
whatever unique independence of mind caused That Woman to single them out for
her mixed blessing. They might choose to be heroes, or selfish villains, or
head out across the realms trying to preach the meaning of the flash of
enlightenment they received, or just get a really good price at market for
their last few beans and work from there.

``A Land Once Divided Must Unite'' is well-suited to Discordians. They are
capable of acting like Solars and leading from the front, though posing
as a series of different leaders is more their style. More likely than
their taking the lead publicly is an approach in which they work behind
the scenes, either to dissolve current overbearing rulership entirely
(rather than replace it with their own), or to persuade a bunch of
fragmented, warring kingdoms to unite under some champion (or dupe) whom
they manipulate into position. Alternatively, they might attempt to
establish alternative channels of influence to bypass authority, just as
House Nellens curries favor with the mortal population of the Realm. And
what better target could there be than the Realm itself? Hmm ... Yu-Shan,
perhaps? This style could easily become ``A Land Once United Must
Divide''.

``And I’ll Form The Head!'' is the closest most Eris-driven games will
come to First Age splendor. Regardless of whether the characters have
come by their fantastical equipment by inheritance, luck or trickery,
their Charms and Numerology will see them use weapons, vehicles and
magic in quite unexpected ways. Also bear in mind that they may not
choose to fight on the side of Creation--Autochthonians, raksha, Yozi and
the Dead all have palatable reasons for characters to fight for them--and
they may not stay on the same side all the time. Lastly, Divisional
Realignment allows the character who initially forms the head to take
her turn at the elbow.

``Outlander'' is especially suitable to the Children of Eris, since they
can adopt a Division or parametadivision which fits them to travel in
other realms. Some of their Charms allow them to find and pass the
barriers between these places more easily, even to the point of
bypassing Cecelyne’s sands or, in a limited fashion, the Seal of Eight
Divinities. Unless all of the cabal choose from a limited set of
Divisions, some members will likely need extra magics to keep them safe
(and Essence-fueled). In the Wyld and in Malfeas, Discordians might
actually draw less attention than in Creation, provided they mask their
Essence signature suitably. To take another perspective on this style,
remember that Discordians appear wherever mortals exist; perhaps they
begin outside Creation, and _it_ becomes the alien world.

``Project: Exalt'' is perhaps the perfect style for Discordians; but
remember the following. Among the maxims on Lord Naoshige's wall is this
one: "Matters of great concern should be treated lightly." Master Ittei
is reported to have said, "Matters of small concern should be treated
seriously."

``Invasion!'' suits Erisians just as ``Outlander'' does, and similarly it
may not be Creation they are defending. Those they seek to help may not
trust them, since they are such an unknown (and, admittedly, not always
trustworthy).

``The Discordians Who Came In From The Cold'' can easily fit if players
want a game of spying and manipulation. The characters may be running
several networks and societies of their own; or, they might be working
for one or more other masters, in return for power and sanctuary, or
because they’ve been blackmailed with the threat of revealing them to
the Wyld Hunt or the Sidereals. Or, they may be serving no master,
working as _agents provocateur_ for the sheer fun of it. The characters
won’t know who to trust, but neither will anyone else.

``Walk the Earth'' is applicable in much the same way as ``Outlander'': the
tendency for them to be mis-remembered means they can be a little more
careless about the adventures they have on the road. Charms can speed up
travel for individuals and groups, broadening the scope of these tales.  A
variation on this is ``And I would've gotten away with it, too, ...'', where
the characters resolve a little bit of trouble and mystery in each place they
visit ... and leave some of their own behind.

==== Alternative Styles

``Vanilla Ripple'' is a slight twist on ``Vanilla Exalted'', in which the
characters start out believing themselves to be the Exalted type which their
parametadivision mimics. They will not receive visions from the Unconquered
Sun, or a personal visit from Luna, but since they won’t know what to expect,
this will come as no more of a surprise than Exaltation already
does. Dragon-Blooded within the Realm or strongly Realm-controlled territories
are not suitable for this game style, since they _do_ know what to expect;
this may also apply to Lookshy and Cherak, less so to miscellaneous outcaste
and found eggs. The characters, and others whom they get to know, will be in
for a shock when certain inconsistencies add up to reveal the incomprehensible
truth.

``Hidden Agenda'' is a game where the characters focus on tring to find out
why they have become what they are. Some theories say Eris hands out her gifts
at random, or that she is only a myth and the Discordian Exaltation is a new
phase of mortal enlightenment. But perhaps there is some specific purpose
behind the introduction of this new power. The original Exalts were weapons in
a war. Is a new war coming? Is the Apocalypse already happening? Or does some
great being have a different sort of goal in mind? And will the characters
actually be satisfied with the answers they find?

``Grand (and gory) Old Discordja!'' is a variation which posits that the
Discordians _were_ around in Creation during the Primordial War and the First
Age. Was their existence known publicly then? Did they survive?  Did they make
it into the history books of the Realm, only to be redacted by the Immaculate
Order, or did they stay out of it thanks to their own Arcane Fate and the help
of the Sidereals? How did they avoid the effects of the Great Curse? Come to
that, which side(s) did they fight on? And presumably, Autochthon knew or at
least suspected who made them--what did he do about them? Lots of questions
and, of course, lots of amazing high-magitech and high-level Charms.

==== Mixed Games

Discordians are Celestial Exalted, and so should be able to hold their
own with most other Exalts, eventually outstripping the Dragon-Blooded.
Finding a reason for other Exalted to work closely with the Children of
Eris may require a bit of creativity, however.

Solars might work with them because they are both Anathema to the
Immaculates, because they believe them to be useful Sidereals or Lunars,
or simply because they need all the allies they can get, and (most)
Discordians at least aren’t Creatures of Darkness.

On the fringes of Creation, the Lunars may be happy to have allies
against the Wyld, the Sidereals and the Realm, once they’re sure the
newcomers aren’t just raksha in some strange guise. The tricksome and
manipulative style of the Erisians could also play well with that of the
Moon-Children.

Sidereals might be duped into thinking the Discordians are some other kind of
Exalt--maybe even Sidereal ronin, though use of Charms which are clearly not
Sidereal may shatter that illusion. Or they may be working with the newcomers
in their usual capacity as ``helpful'' advisers, while frantically trying to
learn what they are.

Infernals could be duped into believing Discordians are of their kind,
at least for a while. They might also be willing to believe a
disaffected Exalt of some other type would join the Yozi’s cause, with
some persuasion. Alternatively, some Erisians might be open about their
strange nature and freely choose to support the Yozi’s escape plans. The
twisted Primordials will hesitate to trust what they cannot control, but
if these Exalts really aren’t aligned with Creation, Oblivion or the
Wyld, they could be very useful.

As long as the Seal of Eight Divinities remains intact, Alchemicals are
likely to react badly to the appearance of Erisian Exalted (either by
bypassing the Seal, or by appearing within the Autochthonian mortal
population). Adamant caste might join with them, having some
fellow-feeling for those who must stay hidden--provided they remain
useful tools. Apostates would be happy to have them as allies, but they
may not make good player characters themselves. If the Seal is breached,
however, Alchemicals will treat them the same as any other of the
strange new Exalted types they meet ... at least until they begin to work
out the correspondences between their own Castes and the Exalted of
Creation, and can’t quite seem to make these Discordians fit. They
couldn’t be the soulsteel equivalents ... could they?

Lastly, the Abyssals are unlikely to form groups with other Exalted
types, unless they are seeking redemption, or have made some
likely-fragile deals. Still, as long as an Erisian maintains a deathly
aspect, they and their deathlord rulers could be tricked into treating
them as any other agent of Oblivion. A very dangerous game, though, so
what reason would a character have for playing it?

Other parametadivisions allow players to move in the realms of
non-Exalted powers. The Mountain Folk are unlikely to be suitable
companions due to their limited power levels and freedom, at least as
long as the geas holds. Raksha might make suitable play-mates,
particularly for the Indivisibles, who are able to engage in Shaping
combat.

=== Power Groups and Factions

(Other factors; e.g., how pervasive, real and helpful are the various
Discordian Societies? Do they all just get in each other’s way, or work
toward some central goal, or are there a few big factions behind the
scenes?)

(Interactions with other Exalted types, and other power groups like
gods, the Yozi/Neverborn, and raksha.)

(Suggestions for infiltrating the various Exalted and other power
groups.)

(Possible big events which could shape a game.)

(Playing in the past.)

=== Locations

(Talk about various places within and outside Creation, and how Erisians
relate to the places, people and powers there.

=== Experience

Except as noted in this section, Discordians gain experience, spend it, and
train to increase Traits at the same rate as Solars, as described in
<<Exalted>>, p. 272–275.  The accompanying Discordian Experience Costs table
gives details of where costs and rates differ.  They gain an experience
discount for only _three_ of their Divisional Attributes, both for raising
Attribute ratings and purchasing Charms, unless they have also selected other
Divisional Attributes as Favored.

*Essence and Maximums:* Essence maximums related to aging so far appear
to follow those for Solars; however, Priests of Eris older than 200 or
so years have never been encountered. This may be because they don’t
last much longer than that, or simply because they really have only
recently be introduced to Creation. Or maybe the elder Discordians are
just better at hiding.
