[verse, with apologies to Paul Simon]
``A man walks down the street
It's a street in a strange world
Maybe it's the Third Age
Maybe it's his first time around
He doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
He is a foreign man
He is surrounded by the sound
The sound
Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterlings and orphanages
He looks around, around
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning in infinity
He says Amen and Hallelujah!''

===== Emperor Nellens Jo-Shu

A couple of seasons after the disappearance of the Scarlet Empress, some
fragments of House Iselsi started to receive reports of a possible new
claimant of power in the Scavenger Lands. Apparently a minor but beloved
middle-aged scion of Nellens, based in one of their River Province
tributaries, had declared himself Emperor Jo-Shu. Agents of the Eye
arrived there a week or two in advance of heavily-armed House Mnemon
``negotiators'', on the chance he would be, or could be made to seem, a
valid successor.

On arrival, however, they were sorely disappointed. The Wood-Aspect
Dragon-Blood in question was clearly insane: dressed in a ragged parody
of proper House attire, unkempt hair filled with fading twigs and
leaves, and a gaze which seemed always half in dream.

Further investigation revealed that his fragile rice trade with the
Blessed Isle had fallen apart with the confusion of the Empress’ fall.
He had become bankrupt, cut off from the main House, and went into
seclusion, living off the remains of his unshipped goods. He was not
seen for several months, then suddenly reappeared in his current sorry
state.

He had indeed proclaimed himself Emperor, but his only ``subjects'' were
local mortals who had previously known of and favored him, humoring him
in his madness. The Eye agents abandoned their quest in disgust. When
the Mnemon party arrived their reactions were a mixture of amusement and
contempt, and they left him alone, considering it a waste of time and
beneath them even to threaten him.

Since then, Emperor Jo-Shu has issued ``currency'' in the form of leaves
and, to the irritation of the Guild, the locals have gone so far as to
carry out some minor trade with them. Indeed, it has had the effect of
stimulating trade, since the ``money'' decays, rather than gaining
interest in a bank, and only Jo-Shu himself can issue more. His
reputation as a pleasant eccentric has grown and he has gained some
informal influence: mad though he may be, he is still a Prince of the
Earth, and capable of using his powers to help his friends. Claiming a
fear of sailing, he has called for a bridge to be built to the Blessed
Isle, so that he can take his rightful place in the Imperial City. A few
volunteers occasionally add some more planks of wood to what is barely
even a pier, but this is all a game, of course.

[[Characters_Signature_Kou-an]]
===== 2nd (Arrow): Kou-an the Barbarian

indexterm:[-,Characters,Signature,Kou-an the Barbarian]The Discordian who
calls himself Kou-an was born among the icewalker tribes of the North, and by
his mid-teens was growing into a role as a skilled but undistinguished
warrior, when he was left stranded by a sudden blizzard which descended on his
hunting party. Expecting to die, he nonetheless struggled on with what
strength remained and, as luck would have it, stumbled into a demesne known to
its inhabitants as the Frozen Oasis (see <<Demesne_The_Frozen_Oasis>>).

He was mystified to be approached by nearly-naked men and women in those
icy wastes, suspecting some raksha trick. When he was told that the only
way for him to survive--until the demesne took away his hunger--was to
choose one of them to eat, he was certain. Torn between the horror at
the thought of cannibalism, fear of being consumed by Wyld things, and
the undeniable desire to survive, he reached a moment of enlightenment,
and was Exalted.

His new-found powers enabled him to survive without eating anyone, but the
strange logic of that encounter inspired him. Along with the usual sensations,
like fairy dust, the following thought entered his mind and lodged there: ``If
they’re our brothers, how come we can’t eat them?'' Now he leads the people of
that place in a tribe some eighty strong, whom he has dubbed ``the
ice-eaters'', roaming the north and protecting his former tribesmen from human
and other predators.  To allow for use of his Recumbent Destiny, Kou-an in
   fact leads his tribe by proxy, through a group of five elders.  When his
people encounter a band of man-eaters such as the Varajtul, they take them
prisoner and bring them to one of the Oases, forcing them to eat each other
for sustenance on the way. In this way the numbers of the cannibals are doubly
reduced, as the survivors soon lose the taste for human flesh, when they are
warped by the demesne. When they find lucky lost souls at their Oasis, they
can now offer sustenance of only part of themselves, with Kou-an healing the
wounds afterwards (after a fashion--there are a few warped bodies in the tribe
now).

===== 3rd (Apple, Division by Zero): Vlad the Inhaler

*[TODO]*

===== 4th: xxx

A serious young man found the conflicts within the Realm, after the
disappearance of the Empress, confusing. He went to many people seeking
a way of resolving within himself the discords that troubled him, but he
remained troubled.

One night in a tea-house, a self-ordained Immaculate Master said to him,
``Go to the dilapidated manse you will find at this address which I have
written down for you. Do not speak to those who live there; you must
remain silent until the moon rises tomorrow night. Go to the large room
on the right of the main hallway, sit in the lotus position on top of
the rubble in the northeast corner, face the corner, and meditate.''

He did as the Immaculate Master instructed. His meditation was
frequently interrupted by worries. He worried whether or not the rest of
the plumbing fixtures would fall from the second floor bathroom to join
the pipes and other debris he was sitting on. He worried how he would
know when the moon rose on the next night. He worried about what the
people who walked through the room said about him.

His worrying and meditation were disturbed when, as if in a test of his
faith, ordure fell from the second floor onto him. At that time two
people walked into the room. The first asked the second who the man
sitting there was. The second replied, ``Some say he is a holy man.
Others say he is a shithead.''

Hearing this, the man was enlightened.
