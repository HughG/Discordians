=== Manses and Demesnes

[[Manse_The_House_of_Mirrors,The House of Mirrors]]
==== The House of Mirrors (Sidereal Manse •••••)

indexterm:[-, Manses, The House of Mirrors]Headquarters of the Cabal of the
same name. This powerful construction is extremely difficult to find, despite
being built at the end of a pier, in the middle of a small lake in the
South-Eastern jungles. Only the attuned hearthstone bearers can find it. It is
made entirely of mirrors and panes of glass, arranged in an ever-shifting
triangular pattern. Anyone who is not an attuned hearthstone bearer may enter
(if they can find it), but cannot easily leave: there is no puzzle to solve,
but characters must spend 5 points of Willpower to bring themselves to ignore
the confounding reflections and leave.

The manse produces five hearthstones: they provide no Essence to an
attuned bearer, but they enable him or her to create up to five magical
doorways to and from the House, though there is a maximum of 23 doorways
at any one time. Such a doorway can only be created in a reflective
surface such as a mirror, shield, pool, or sheet of ice. The doorway is
only visible to and usable by a hearthstone bearer. Creating a doorway
takes a day of focused meditation, and 2 points of Willpower, after
which it persists until the object is destroyed, or the doorway is
reallocated. A bearer can only create a doorway to the manse, from
wherever he currently stands: he cannot open doors from the manse to
arbitrary locations. However, the doorways can reach back from any realm
of reality. Walking through the doorway requires the expenditure of 5
motes of Essence or one point of Willpower.

Reallocation of a doorway can happen if the bearer has already created
five doorways, or he has created fewer, but 23 have been created by all
bearers combined. In that case, he may choose any one existing doorway
to be re-used. The object to which it is attached will return to normal.
When reallocating a doorway, a hearthstone bearer will know which
doorway was most recently used by each other hearthstone bearer; thus he
can avoid inconveniencing them too much. If an object with an attached
doorway is destroyed, the doorway disappears and becomes free for
reallocation.

Those holding a hearthstone may read, in the depths of the reflections,
around them, a number of useful facts about the physical and social
surroundings which exist on the other side of each doorway. This
information is far from complete, but studying it for a scene before
passing through any given doorway allows them &#x2B;5 dice on any rolls to
blend in socially with the target area, or to convince others they they
are familiar with it. This bonus applies to only one area at a time, for
each hearthstone bearer.

[[Manse_The_Pentagon,The Pentagon]]
==== The Pentagon (Air Manse ••••)

indexterm:[-, Manses, The Pentagon]Somewhere deep in the mountains to the east
of the Silent Crescent lies The Pentagon, the heart of a Discordian
(dis-)information and intelligence-gathering network, home of the Austral
Illuminati. This manse is connected to others which share information on
politics, happenings and plots throughout multiple realities. Quite how many
reporting stations there are, where they lie, and what qualities they possess,
is unknown.

The manse is a low, five-sided structure of black basalt with hardened
adamant slit windows watching all access paths. It includes a central
courtyard of the same shape, and the internal windows are similarly
hardened. The overall structure has been carefully constructed to blend
in with its surroundings, despite its regular structure, so attempts to
locate it physically are at a -4 external penalty. The terrain around it
is harsh but access ways do exist, whose locations are a closely-guarded
secret.

There are three floors below ground housing the library and the
information-processing systems of its workers. The hearth room is two
floors below ground, in the center, and is a dodecahedral chamber with
smoky matte walls, the hearthstone floating in mid-air at the center.

[role="noindent"]
*Game Effects:*

Creation Points: 12

* Rating: 8
* Hearthstone Sacrifice: 2
* Maintenance: 2. 42 of The Grey Men (or an equivalent number of other
volunteers) must walk in procession 23 times around around the inner
courtyard, following the internal walls, muttering specific
incomprehensible secrets under their breath. This takes most of the day,
and must be performed monthly. This ritual might draw the attention of
nearby or overhead observers.

Powers:

* Network Node: 1. The manse is connected to a number of other
intel-collection outposts across Creation (and possibly in other
realms).
* Externally Hardened: 2. A reduced version of the Armored power: the
manse has an increased soak of 14L/21B externally, due to its
Essence-reinforced basalt shell, but still only 6L/12B internally.
* Basic Provider: 2. Like Provider, but only caters for a group of
Magnitude equal to (rating – 1), _i.e._, 3, or 150 people. The air is
breathable but feels stale, the food is nourishing but bland, and so on.
* Bound Intelligence Staff: 2. Like Bound Servant Force, but provides a
group up to (rating – 1). Specifically, there are 115 Grey Men:
human-like figures with empty, unreflective black eyes, who serve as
investigators, analysts, defenders and occasionally hosts. They have the
Virtue attributes of automata, though they still need to breath and eat;
whether they are affected by poison is unknown.
* Intelligence Library: 3. Like Archive, but only covers 3 Specialties,
which must be in Investigation, Lore, Occult, Larceny, Bureaucracy,
Linguistics or Socialize. The set of specialties can be changed over
time by the intelligence operations of the Grey Men and the connected
manses, at the rate of 1 dot per two seasons. The training effect of an
Archive exists, but each student may learn at most three specialties (or
increase three Abilities) from the Library, even if its contents later
change.
* Grey Dragon’s Wing: 3. Like Veil of Shadows, but additionally makes it
impossible to sense the geomantic Essence flows around it. As far as
outside observers with geomantic awareness can tell, it’s not a manse,
and there’s no convergence of dragon lines which would make it worth
building one here. Within the walls, the manse’s nature may be sensed as
normal.

*Other Notes:* The Grey Men all look alike, characterless though not

pre-packaged charges. Each canister holds 6 shots, and requires one
Miscellaneous Action to replace. A Grey Man will typically have one or
two spare canisters on his person, or more if expecting trouble.

These beings seem to be some kind of artificial construct and, as such,
have some supernatural powers.

_Linguistic Facility:_ All Grey Men know one language in addition to
High Realm. They may change this language once per day via an arcane

_Reanimation:_ As long as the manse does not suffer power failure, any
Grey Men destroyed will reform over the course of 23 hours in the hearth
room, with memories intact and a new flame piece. The original,
including flame piece, will crumble to dust over the same period.

_Limited Independent Functioning:_ Any of these servants may range up to
115 yards from the building, and up to 23 of them at any time may travel

[[Demesne_The_Frozen_Oasis,The Frozen Oasis]]
==== The Frozen Oasis (Lunar Demesne •••)

indexterm:[-,Demesnes,The Frozen Oasis]This demesne is referred to in the
singular but either it somehow moves around (perhaps being half in the Wyld)
or there are several similar demesnes scattered across the North. It is
difficult to spot, even for the trained tracker, because on the surface it
appears as unremarkable, rough, snow- and ice-covered ground. Below, however,
is a solidified lake several hundred yards across and perhaps equally deep,
filled with unnatural not-quite-crystalline formations of ice. Those sensitive
to Essence will recognize its nature with ease, of course.

The first mortals to stumble into this demesne were a band of lost and
injured icewalkers, who turned to cannibalism to survive. However, they
were amazed to find that, after butchering and eating only one of their
number, they lost all desire to eat meat, and survived purely on the
snow which they used as a water source. Their fear of retribution for
breaking taboo led them to keep themselves isolated, and their shame has
made them offer themselves as temporary sustenance to the rare few who
have since stumbled upon this desperate place.

In the last year, however, this demesne has been taken over by Kou-an the
Barbarian (see <<Characters_Example_Kou-an>>) and its inhabitants have found
some hope for redemption.

[role="noindent"]
*Game Effects:* After two weeks in the Oasis, mortals begin to gain an
Affliction which allows them to ignore the effects of extreme (natural)
cold, along with a Debility which means they can only survive by eating
snow, ice or other forms of frozen water. They are still capable of
digesting normal food--including that taboo delicacy, human flesh--but
gain neither savour nor sustenance from it. These effects take hold
gradually, so the character is at a -4 internal penalty to all actions
in the third week, -3 in the fourth, and so on, until they are
functioning at normal capacity by week seven. Converted mortals also
gain the peculiar ability to tell, by scent at short range, the gamut of
a creature’s diet over the last month.

The Essence harvest of the Oasis is found in flurries of snow which
appear from nowhere, and disappear just as easily. Successfully
collecting this token leaves one covered in a rime of frost, which
persists for a week, before melting away. Botching the harvest leaves a
character part frozen and blinded, at a -2 penalty to movement and
vision for a week.

=== Artifacts

*[TODO]*

==== Tools

*[TODO: Set of prayer beads that expands to an artifact fighting chain.]*

[[Artifact_Armor_Propre,Armor Propre]]
===== Armor Propre (Artifact ••–•••)

indexterm:[-,Artifacts,Armor Propre]This variant strand of artifact armors was
founded by a particularly brash and self-confident member of the Apple Corps,
who commissioned what he dubbed the ``Breastplate of Self-Confidence''. All
such armors cost an additional 2 motes to attune and have a penalty of -1 to
their lethal and bashing soak and hardness. By way of compensation they have
an additional effect, reliant on the wearer’s self-belief. If the character
stunts a Parry defense or does not defend, and manages to either parry the
attack or fully soak the damage, he gains a point of Willpower. This occurs
even if the parry stunt fails, but _not_ if the character uses his Dodge DV.

[[Artifact_Brush_of_Expedient_Formulation,Brush of Expedient Formulation]]
===== Brush of Expedient Formulation (Artifact ••)

indexterm:[-,Artifacts,Brush of Expedient Formulation]This brush outwardly
resembles a Silver Brush (<<BoS3_Oadenol>>, p. 32) and will function as such,
although it requires a commitment of 5 motes.  However, the core mixes
moonsilver into the normal orichalcum, increasing the persuasiveness of the
writer’s words. Using this brush for any Bureaucracy or Socialize action in
written form gains the character a 4-die bonus.

[[Artifact_Stone_of_Bamboozlement,Stone of Bamboozlement]]
===== Stone of Bamboozlement (Artifact ••)

indexterm:[-,Artifacts,Stone of Bamboozlement]This creation comes in the form
of a smooth grey stone, roughly the size of a hen’s egg. It was crafted by a
Discordian artificer to make it easier for her to remain hidden.

While attuned, for a cost of 5 motes, the owner of the stone finds her
Recumbent Destiny enhanced, increasing the difficulty of rolls to
remember her. The difficulty is increased by 1 for the first week in
which she keeps this artifact attuned, and this rises by a further 1
after each full week of continuous attunement, to a maximum total
increase equal to the character’s Essence. However, the difficulty to
suppress her Recumbent Destiny increases by the same amount.

Additionally, the character gains a 2-die bonus to any Charisma,
Manipulation or Appearance rolls related to convincing people that she
is not whoever they think she is, even if they have seen through her
Recumbent Destiny. To gain this bonus, she must know who the target
believes her to be.

==== Keepsakes

[[Artifact_Stone_of_Belonging,Stone of Belonging]]
===== Stone of Belonging (Artifact •••)

indexterm:[-,Artifacts,Stone of Belonging]This smooth white stone is roughly
the size of a duck’s egg. It was created by the same craftswoman who invented
the Stone of Bamboozlement, to make it easier for her to remain
_un_hidden. This artifact costs 8 motes to attune.

The attuned owner of this stone finds her Recumbent Destiny completely
suppressed (if she has one), and her apparent identity changed to one of
her own devising. This identity may mimic a real person, or be a
complete fabrication. She gains 3 bonus successes on Larceny rolls to
create and maintain this disguise, and on rolls to oppose others seeing
through it. However, she must spend 5 motes to transfer the effect to
another disguise, and cannot ``disguise'' herself as her true identity.
Attempts to appear as anyone one other than the chosen identity receive
a 5-die penalty as long as the artifact remains attuned.

Also, separate from the specific identity she chooses, the character
gains a 2-die bonus to any Bureaucracy, Lore, Performance or Socialize
rolls related to convincing people that she belongs in some location,
organization or situation appropriate to that identity. For example, a
character could not apply this bonus to attempts to convince others that
she was Mnemon, but could apply it if merely trying to pass as some
miscellaneous individual who had the right to be in one of her palaces.

Finally, a Discordian using this artifact need only spend motes and
Willpower, not commit them, to change her apparent Essence signature to
match her Affinity, or to suppress it altogether, provided the change
fits her disguise.

[[Artifact_The_Cabal-ah,The Cabal-ah]]
===== The Cabal-ah (Artifact •••)

indexterm:[-,Artifacts,The Cabal-ah]The Cabal-ah is a document consisting of
15 pages of some strange, indestructible paper-like material, bound together
with various colors of ribbon. Each bears writing in contemporary, forgotten
and unknown languages, and various symbols from the many realms of
reality. These pages do not open like a book, or unroll like a scroll; rather
they unfold and re-fold so that any one can be made visible at a time.

This mystical tome enhances its owner’s ability to work the strange art
of Numerology. Attuning the Cabal-ah costs 8 motes of Essence.
Thereafter, whenever the bearer takes a Numerology action, the bearer
can spend Essence to gain additional Numerology points towards her
effect, at the cost of 2 motes each, and up to a maximum of her
permanent Essence. In addition, the book reduces the Speed of a
Numerological Assay to 1. On the other hand, the expenditure of a
character’s Essence puts her signature on the effect, adding bonus dice
to valid attempts to discover its source, equal to the number of
Numerology points gained.

[[Magic_Item_Dragons_Blood,Dragon's Blood]]
===== Dragon's Blood (Resources N/A)

indexterm:[-,Magic Items,Dragon's Blood]The existence of this potion is a
secret closely guarded by those few who have managed to secure a sample or
supply.  It is an odorless, tasteless liquid which is almost entirely clear:
it comes in five variants, once for each of the elements of Creation, and each
dose has a very slight shading of the relevant color.

When drunk it has no effect except on Dragon-Blooded, and unexalted mortals
who are descended from them within up to five generations.  Dragon-Blooded
effectively have their Breeding background increased by 3 dots, to a maximum
of 8, with its benefits extrapolated.  Thus, a Dragon-Blooded Exalt who
naturally had a Breeding rating of 5 would find herself with &#x2B;8 motes in
her Personal Essence pool, &#x2B;15 in her Peripheral, able to activate her
anima banner at no cost until the dose wore off, and any children conceived
while it remained in her system would gain &#x2B;5 on the roll to see if they
would Exalt.  *[TODO: Does &#x2B;5 make sense for that roll?  What is it?
Couldn't find it in the MoEP:DB.]* The one exception is that aspect markings
do not become significantly more pronounced.

On unexalted mortals who carry the blood of the Dragons, the effect is more
dramatic: until the elixir leaves their system, they gain access to their
Exalted heritage.  Their Essence rating does not increase so, except for
enlightened martial artists, they will have very small mote pools.  They gain
immediate access to a set of Charms appropriate to a starting character (and
gain the same set each time, if they take subsequent doses).

The potion's effects last for at least 23 days; thereafter the character who
consumed it must succeed on a (Willpower &#x2B; Essence) roll each day to hold
on to the power, at a cumulative -1 penalty each day.  Allowing the power to
lapse while one's anima is active is not advisable.  For unexalted mortals, if
they reach the point where they might naturally have taken their second breath
while the potion is in effect, they add &#x2B;3 to their roll.  However, if
that point comes within a year _after_ they have consumed a dose, they suffer
a -3 external penalty.

Dragon's Blood is the product of a custom Charm developed by *[TODO: name]*,
as an extension of <<Craft_eed>>.  As such, the supply is strictly limited,
and nobody has been able to reproduce it so far.  She has used it more than
once to raise mortals to a less-than-genuine Exalted state and keep them
dependent on her.  So far she has not allowed any of them to fall from grace,
though at least one has died in battle, but it may yet happen, and it is hard
to imagine what the Dragon-Blooded host will make of that.

indexterm:[-, Diseases, Contrariety]
[role="noindent"]
*Virulence:* 1 *Difficulty to Treat:* 3

[role="noindent"]
*Morbidity:* 4 *Treated Morbidity:* 1

[role="noindent"]
*Symptoms:* Never directly fatal, this is truly a disease of Virtue. Its
victims gradually come to hold a negative Intimacy towards some group or
society to which they belong, leading them to work against its aims, or
even attempt to dismantle it outright. If one already holds one or more
positive Intimacies towards such groups, the disease will take root in
one of those, and reverse it; if not, it will form a new Intimacy,
displacing something else. Having its roots in the Wyld, this disease is
a Sickness effect, and can infect Exalted.

[role="noindent"]
*Duration:* The infected individual will show no symptoms for 4–8 weeks,
though they are infectious after only 1 week. Symptoms begin sooner if
the victim is brought into conflict with the relevant group in some way.
He will become at first irritated by, then antagonistic towards, the
relevant group. This takes as many weeks as he has dots of Conviction.
Unless treated, the new Intimacy then takes root, changing or displacing
another. The person then remains contagious for as many months as they
have dots of Conviction. Past that point, the disease has run its
course, and the Intimacy may be changed as normal.

[role="noindent"]
*Vector:* The disease is passed from person to person, spreading more
easily through sex or blood-exchange--moments when one is bonded closely
to only one other person, rather than a group. In such circumstances its
Virulence rises to 4.

[role="noindent"]
*Treatment:* Certain herbs which provoke a heightened sense of
camaraderie and affection can be brewed to counter this infection.
However, these feelings tend to lead to intimate contact, so the cure
may provoke infection of others, unless the patient is isolated until
the sickness is purged.

Erisian Elementals are few enough in number that they have never been
known to form courts of their own. That said, several who manifest in
one location may band together, for work or company, and most are open
to alliances with existing elementals.

Although not officially part of the Terrestrial Bureaucracy or its
analogues in other realms, these spirits turn out to be subject to same
rules of summoning. Few Erisian Elementals are actually summoned,
because they are relatively rare and so few sorcerers are aware of their
existence--or, in the case of the Dragon-Blooded, willing to entertain
such heresy. Nonetheless, the description for each gives some ideas of
the issues summoners might encounter.

explosions and impacts, and work to ensure a steady supply of such
experiences. They appear near active volcanoes occasionally, but the violence
of those formations tends to be sporadic, and the action already monopolized
by powerful entrenched spirits.

As with all Erisian Elementals, these spirits rarely manifest in areas
strictly controlled by the theomacracy or the hierarchies of
Autochthon’s own subroutines. However, where they do appear, they are
more powerful than most Erisian Elementals, given the many things within
the Maker which have a tendency to go ``boom''. They are most likely to
appear near sources of lightning, metal or steam, or near machinery
which makes lots of noise. Natives might think they are Void-tainted
subroutines but in fact they are dire enemies of any Gremlins who would
disrupt the lovely noisiness of the Maker’s processes. The Grom
themselves may at times ``tune'' those processes to be more noisy, and
hence less efficient, but generally have enough foresight not to
irreparably damage the things they enjoy so much.

[[Elemental_Night_Watcher,Night Watcher]]
===== Night Watcher

indexterm:[-, Elementals, Night Watcher]
indexterm:[-, Erisian Elementals, Night Watcher]These elementals have not been
formally studied and have the name ``Night Watcher'' only from folk tales,
told to children who fear that something is hiding in their bedroom at
night. The stories are wrong to suggest that they only come out at night, but
they accurately capture the elementals’ nature in that they are inconsistent
about whether these beings come to protect, threaten or simply observe.

Night Watchers are insubstantial in their material state. Attempts to
perceive or attack them when relying on normal senses are at a -4
external penalty, though Essence sight or powers which detect spirits
will see them normally. To those who can see them, they appear as a
translucent, pale grey humanoid shape with a fluid outline, and eyes
which seem to reflect shifting lights which are not really there. This
is not only a visual property: those without magical weapons will find
it hard to wound a Night Watcher. On the other hand, these elementals
are incapable of making natural physical attacks, though they are
unlikely to fight in any manner unless attacked.

[role="noindent"]
*Summoning:* These elementals are suited to being bound to tasks
involving surveillance, ambush or wearing down the psyche of enemies. If
abcsissic binding is to be used, the Warden, Hunter and Functionary
plates are most suitable. A successful summoner is not automatically
granted the power to see the elemental clearly. At least one Night
Watcher has escaped summoning by playing on the sorcerer’s uncertainties
until she believed that she had failed, waiting until she abandoned the
spell and then leaving. More commonly they are accidentally beckoned by
a thaumaturge who is not quite precise enough about the type of spirit
he seeks. They may manifest spontaneously if a child is repeatedly
terrified of (usually) imagined horrors at night. In such cases they are
more likely to use their Gifts of Trepidation Charm after some
observation.

[role="noindent"]
*Motivation:* Witness the emotions of creatures who feel they are being
watched.

*Attributes:* Strength 2, Dexterity 4, Stamina 2, Charisma 2,

may be about to be subject to a surprise attacked (regardless of whether
they really are). Awareness, when the foregoing conditions really do
apply (regardless of whether the target knows or believes it), or when
the target is specifically watching someone else.

or following.

to be subject to a surprise attack, or both.

increase the target’s Valor or Awareness by 1 dot as a Training effect,
which may incur experience debt. Target must be in line of sight, or
successfully target by one of the Elemental’s other Charms in the same
scene. May be used no more than once per target.
