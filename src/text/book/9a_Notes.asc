Hagbard Celine from the Illuminatus Trilogy – travels in a golden
submarine. ``Finally, Hagbard Celine reveals himself as the fifth
Illuminatus Primus; he has been playing both sides against each other in
order to keep balance. He is a representative of the ‘true’ Illuminati,
whose aim is to spread the idea that everybody is free to do whatever
they want at all times.''

Could have some way of co-opting existing Exaltations (probably just by
their owners having a flash of insight), converting existing Solars etc.
into Discordians. Might only work for Essence <= 5. I imagine the
Exaltation would return to normal after that lifetime. Not akuma or
Infernal, so no new Urge, but possibly a change in Motivation, with the
previous Motivation remaining as an Intimacy. Would need rules for
pre-generating, and for converting. I’m imagining existing Charms must
be ``sold off'' before new ones can be bought, starting at the leaves of
Charm trees, which will make the character less powerful in that
transition period. Probably no Echoes Background.

Maybe this happens spontaneously and/or maybe it’s achieved as part of
Divisional Realignment, using some comedy monstrance-alike box--``think
yourself out of your box'' ;-)

=== Interstitial Stories/Cartoons

==== Arriving by Boat

Small boat, barely more than a raft, drifts towards a metal shore, on a
sea of oil, gradually sinking. Strange Figure clad in bio-fabrics climbs
mast, peeling off clothes as he does so, jumping to cling to the metal
rim as the boat disappears.

SF (to self, in Seatongue): ``Hmm, now, I’m sure I’m forgetting something
... (slaps forehead) Oh, yes! (Removes hand, showing newly-appeared
soulgem – clear diamond, brilliant cut, _i.e._, Alchemical-style. Skin
should also go clay-like, if cartoon details permit.) That’s better.''

Populat work-crew nearby hears noise, comes to investigate.

PW1 (female, shocked; in Autochthonian, natch): What? ... who are you?
What in the Void are you doing out here like ... that?

PW2 (male, awkward whisper to PW1): This is highly irregular. We should
call for help. What was that thing sticking out of the oil?

SF (in Autochthonian): What, don’t you recognize me? Tell me you’ve seen
at least _some_ of my posters. Only recently constructed, I know, and
I’ve been off in the Reaches too much, maybe.

PW1 (whispers back, slightly glint/grin): You know, I haven’t seen one
of them quite so, err ... at such close range, but ...

PW2 (frowning): It could be, I’m not sure ...

SF (looking plaintively hopeful): Surely you’ve heard of me, the Highly
Implausible Visitor?

PW2 (look of shocked recognition): Oh! Yes, how stupid of me! Our
apologies, Exalted, you don’t look quite the same without your ... err,
that is ...

SF: Ah, that’s alright, I understand. Now, I need your clothes, your
boots and your swift rider.

PW1 (eagerly): Of course! You’re about my size, aren’t you? Anything to
help the Chosen of the Maker. (Starts stripping off ...)

==== Confusing the Bandits

Small group of bandits advancing on brave but ill-prepared townsfolk.

Erisian Exalted rides up on horse, armed and armored not much better
than the bandits.

EE: ``Hold, foul brigands! What’s going on here?''

FB1: ``Who’re you calling foul? That horse’s seen better days.''

FB2: ``We’re taking whatever we like, that’s what. You got a problem with
that?''

EE: ``No, no. Excellent! Keep up the good work!'' Rides off.

FB2: ``What was all that about?''

FB1: ``I’ve no idea.'' Turns to face villagers, who are equally confused
to be wielding much better weapons than they were a moment ago.

==== Manic Street Preacher

[Beggar / preacher at side of road tells people to do X.  Passing members of
organization O hear this and are affected, as by (Bur) Mission Restatement
Process.  Organized chaos ensues ...]

Before I was a Discordian, I was distressed by the inefficiency and
inhumanity of organizations. Now I am vindicated by their inefficiency
and inhumanity.

... [our] most exalted testament of all is The Honest Book of Truth - of
which there is, alas, only one copy locked away in the Closed Stacks of
the Akashic Records.

``mondo'': ``Perhaps best of all is simply uttering a mondo. That is like
picking up the telephone when it rings and saying, ``Wrong number,
please!'' However much you think about a mondo it makes no sense - even
clamps and pliers cannot get hold of it. Yet at the same time, if it is
a good mondo, the longer you think about it the more it seems like it
ought to make sense – although you can never figure out why. Beyond that
much, a truly great mondo sticks to your mind like hot pine pitch –
gumming up your thought process for weeks on end.''

Besides the pen is only mighter than the sword at a range greater than
five feet.

Perhaps occasionally the soul of Emperor Norton descends once more into
the world to momentarily inhabit the body of an otherwise
undistinguished infidel.

According to L.A. Rollins in Lucifer’s Lexicon a Discordian is one who
likes to wear Emperor Norton’s old clothes.

Discordianism is not just a religion; it is a mental illness.

If the Discordian Society is to become the world’s next great cargo cult
it will be due to the efforts of the House of Mirrors. Not only have we
nunneries, but recognized and accepted heresies, powerful lobbies
complete with popcorn concessions and everything from progressive
belaboring unions to square sewing circles.

OR

If the Discordian Society is to become the world’s next great cargo cult
it will be due to the efforts of the bewildering array of
subdisorganizations which make up our internal structure, fashioned from
the original blueprint for the Manhatten Beach Pier House of Mirrors.

No matter whether he calls himself Greyface or the Anti-``Bob'' he acts
like the Devil, because his most famous line is: ``Let me organize it for
you!''

But no doubt you are also curious about Eris. Where does she hang out
these days - now that Olympus has gone tourist? Eris Discordia is in
Limbo, where all we virtuous pagans and our gods and goddesses go
between lifetimes.

There is no prohibition against prayer - which is not to say we think it
is a wise activity.

Eristic Avatars are sent down into Reality, the original Rorschach, for
the purpose keeping things from becoming so well ordered that they stop
working. This they often accomplish by insisting that certain arbitrary
interpretations of reality are the only valid ones. That causes Strife
which results in Confusion which revitalizes Holy Chaos.

... as the Taoist sage Chuang Tzu simply said, ``The more laws there are,
the more crime there is.''

In Limbo there are only five laws: 1) No making anybody do anything they
don’t want, except mind their own business; 2) No shitting or pissing in
the streets; 3) No spitting on the floors; 4) No undated notices on the
bulletin board; 5) No eating of hotdog buns. That sounds like a program
that will work for me because there is nothing in there against swiping
jokes.

That was Greg showing off his rubber stamp collection. Few hobbies are
as psychologically gratifying - especially when some bureaucrat is
making you wait, with his or her back to you for a moment - as
collection rubber stamps.

A secret method of identifying your Discordianship for the benefit of
other Discordians is by wearing a pull-off aluminum beer-can tab, strung
through its ring, around your neck. That is called an All-Seeing Eye of
Eris (complete with Tear) ...

Do not for a moment think you cannot be an exceptional orator if you can
just find some way to keep repeating yourself hypnotically and changing
the subject of your speech frequently at the same time.

5. An Age of Confusion, or an Ancient Age, is one in which History As
We Know It begins to unfold, in which Whatever Is Coming emerges in
Corporal Form, more or less, and such times are Ages of Balanced
Unbalance, or Unbalanced Balance.
6. An Age of Bureaucracy is an Imperial Age in which Things Mature, in
which Confusion becomes entrenched and during which Balanced Balance, or
Stagnation, is attained.
7. An Age of Disorder or an Aftermath is an Apocalyptic Period of
Transition back to Chaos through the Screen of Oblivion into which the
Age passeth, finally. These are Ages of Unbalanced Unbalance.

``... under Eris Confusion became established, and was hence called
Bureaucracy; while over Bureaucracy Eris became established, and was
hence called Discordia'' – Book of Uterus, 1:7

The Five Orders of Discordia (``Them''). The seeds of the ORDERS OF
DISCORDIA were planted by Greyface into his early disciples. ... The
Orders are composed of persons all hung up on authority, security and
control; i.e., they are blinded by the Aneristic Illusion. They do not
know that they belong to Orders of Discordia. But we know.

* The Military Order of THE KNIGHTS OF THE FIVE SIDED TEMPLE. This is
for all of the soldiers and bureaucrats of the world. (Apple)
* The Political Order of THE PARTY FOR WAR ON EVIL. This is reserved for
lawmakers, censors, and like ilk. (Anvil)
* The Academic Order of THE HEMLOCK FELLOWSHIP. They commonly inhabit
schools and universities, and dominate many of them. (Archway)
* The Social Order of THE CITIZENS COMMITTEE FOR CONCERNED CITIZENS.
This is mostly a grass-roots version of the more professional military,
political, academic and sacred Orders. (Arrow)
* The Sacred Order of THE DEFAMATION LEAGUE. Not much is known about the
D.L., but they are very ancient and quite possibly were founded by
Greyface himself. It is known that they now have absolute domination
over all organized churches in the world. It is also believed that they
have been costuming cabbages and passing them off as human beings. (Anchor)
