    This is an alpha release of <emphasis role="strong">The Manual of Exalted
    Prowess&#x2014;Discordians</emphasis>.  I, Hugh Greene, the original
    author, hereby disclaim all copyright over it.  That said, it is a derived
    work based on the <emphasis role="strong">Exalted</emphasis> intellectual
    property of White Wolf, so their lawyers are likely to come after you if
    you try to make money from this.  (Their website used to contain a
    specific license for derived works, and I would reference it, but I can't
    find it now.)

    Anyone in White Wolf is, as far as I'm concerned, welcome to make money
    from this.  However, the tool-chain I used to produce the PDF version
    makes use of the OFFO Hyphenation Library (offo.sourceforge.net), which
    does not allow commercial use by default.  I expect that another
    hyphenation source could be used with FOP, or a commercial license agreed
    with the OFFO authors, but I don't know.
