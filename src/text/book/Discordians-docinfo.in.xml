    This is an alpha release of <emphasis role="strong">The Manual of Exalted
    Prowess&#x2014;Discordians</emphasis>.  I, Hugh Greene, the original
    author, hereby disclaim all copyright over it.  That said, it is a derived
    work based on the <emphasis role="strong">Exalted</emphasis> intellectual
    property of White Wolf, so their lawyers are likely to come after you if
    you try to make money from this.  (Their website used to contain a
    specific license for derived works, and I would reference it, but I can't
    find it now.)

    Anyone in White Wolf is, as far as I'm concerned, welcome to make money
    from this.  However, be aware of licensing restrictions on the fonts,
    libraries, and other tools involved.  For example, producing the PDF
    version makes use of the OFFO Hyphenation Library (offo.sourceforge.net),
    which requires that some files are renamed if modified (for example, to
    provide better hyphenation of Exalted terms).
