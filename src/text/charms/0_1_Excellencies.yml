  Each mote spend on this charm adds 1 die to the pool for the relevant roll,
  to a maximum of (Ability + stunt rating) motes.  If used to enhance a static
  value, roll the number of dice provided by this Charm and add one to the
  static value for each success.

  With a suitable stunt and a surcharge, can be used to enhance an action
  using any _other_ Ability. The action cannot involve activation of Charms
  from the other Ability, though it may involve the effects of Permanent
  Charms or those which are not counted as a Charm activation.  The surcharge
  is 1m for Abilities in the same Division, 2m for those in a neighboring
  Division, or 4m for those in the other two Divisions.  The maximum number of
  dice which can be added is based on the _lower_ of the two Abilities--the
  Ability for which this Excellency has been purchased and the other Ability
  for which it is being activated.  If this Charm is used in combination with
  the Second or Third Excellencies, the surcharge is paid only once for the
  action, not once for each Excellency activated.  This flexibility explicitly
  does not extend to allowing an Excellency in one Ability to be used as a
  prerequisite for a Charm in another, only to affect rolls or static values
  based on other Abilities.

  This Charm adds one guaranteed success to a dice roll, or one to a static
  value, for every two motes spent, to a maximum of (Ability + stunt rating)
  motes.  Each success purchased is the equivalent of adding two dice with the
  First Excellency or any other dice-adding Charm, and counts toward the
  Discordian dice-adding limit.  This Excellency can be used to enhance
  actions from other Abilities in the same manner as the First Excellency.

  A character invokes this Charm after making a roll based on the chosen
  Ability, tipping the balance in her favor for a moment, in the knowledge
  that it will tip back before long.  It adds (Ability รท 2) automatic
  successes to the roll, or increases a static value by a like amount.
  Successes added by this Excellency do _not_ count towards the Discordian
  limit on dice added by Charms.  However, the next non-trivial use of that
  Ability is subject to an equal external penalty.  The Storyteller is free to
  decide what constitutes an important use--the intent is to prevent a player
  freeing a character from this looming redress by taking some irrelevant
  action such as tying a shoelace.

  This Excellency can be used to enhance actions from other Abilities in the
  same manner as the First Excellency.  Unlike the Third Excellency of several
  other types of Exalt, it _can_ be used in Combos with the First and Second
  Excellencies.

  Each two motes spent on this Charm reduces the cost of the first three
  Excellencies by one for the scene, when used with the selected Ability.  It
  recudes the cost by no more than the character's permanent Essence, and to a
  minimum of zero motes.  It cannot be used to reduce the cost when an
  Excellency is stretched to apply to other Abilities.

  A Discordian activates this Charm specifically to counter the efforts of
  those engaged in dynamic imbalance against him.  It forces the target to
  re-roll his action and accept the less desirable of the two results.  If the
  target uses some Charm or other power which allows a re-roll, the cost of
  both are spent but no re-roll takes place, and the target keeps the original
  roll.  This Charm cannot be used to oppose actions which do not involve a
  roll, nor can it be used to affect static values.  It does not alter the
  target's being or traits in a permanent way, only the transitory playing out
  of an action, so many Shaping defences--such as the Lawgiver's
  Integrity-Protecting Prana or the Pyrian Ego-Infused Pattern Primacy--will
  not prevent its effects.  Like the Excellencies, Insolencies can be used
  against actions from other Abilities, by paying a like surcharge.

  At times the interference of Erisian Exalts is subtle and elaborate, at
  others more direct.  This Charm targets another being making a roll or using
  a static value.  Spending three motes on this Charm increases the target
  number for the opponent to 8 or reduces a static value to three-quarters of
  its normal, while spending six motes increases the target value to 9 or
  reduces a static value by half.  Reduced static values are rounded up and
  cannot be reduced to zero.  Rolled actions also cannot botch, always
  achieving at least one success.  This Charm can only be applied against
  actions which affect the character directly, be it individually or as part
  of a group.  Again, this Insolency can oppose actions from other Abilities
  for a surcharge.
