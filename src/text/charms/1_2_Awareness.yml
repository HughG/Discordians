  This Charm supplements any action, removing all external penalties due to
  the character's senses being obscured.  This covers most sensory penalties,
  such as wearing a blindfold, acting in complete darkness, etc.  It does not
  apply to internal penalties such as blindness, however.

  The Chosen of Eris invokes this Charm in response to an attack which is
  initially unexpected, and which she fails to block or dodge.  This Charm is
  applicable even if the character has used some other effect to make it no
  longer unexpected: it works because the attacker believes their attack is a
  surprise.  The character is permitted a counterattack against the original
  attack, and against any other attacks, unexpected or not, until her next
  action.  This Charm does not guarantee that a counterattack is possible
  (e.g., ranged attackers may not be valid targets), only that the opportunity
  exists.

  The Wholly Fools see the inner and outer worlds of body and mind as one, and
  may attend to or ignore any part with equal ease.
  
  This Charm has two alternative effects.  Activated in one way, in Step 2 of
  social combat, the character turns his focus inward, ignoring the pressures
  of the outside world.  In this way it provides a perfect social dodge, even
  against social attacks which are undodgeable.  Afterwards, he will remember
  that the attack occurred, who made it (if he was aware of that), and that he
  defended himself against it, but will have no memory of the intent of the
  attack nor the content of the communication which delivered it.
  
  On the other hand, the character may activate it on Step 1 to turn his focus
  entirely outward.  This enables him to take one action which ignores any
  ongoing Compulsion, Illusion or Emotion effect, or to suppress a Virtue
  without paying a point of Willpower.  This does not allow him to sidestep
  Servitude effects, since their continuing power is focused in the outside
  world, nor does it fend off the impact of Limit Break.  In addition, since
  he is ignoring his Virtues, he cannot channel them on this action.

  TODO
  
  With this Charm, the Ignorant Child is able to apply all his senses at every
  point within (Essence x 10) yards simultaneously, regardless of intervening
  barriers.  This effectively means that he can see through walls, behind
  people's backs and so on.  Any external penalties to his senses may be
  reduced by up to (Essence) points, at storyteller discretion, if they do not
  apply over most of the area.  For example, attempting to blind the character
  by shining a light or throwing sand in his eyes will likely be ineffective.
  
  He cannot be surprised by an attack from behind, from cover etc., and
  penalties from coordinated attacks are reduced by (Essence).  The character
  can still be surprised by things which his current senses cannot perceive,
  e.g., attackers who suddenly materialize, or by things which do not appear
  dangerous, e.g., a disguised assassin.
  
  The power of this Charm applies equally well to any unusual senses which the
  character may have, e.g., to see spirits, sense Essence flows etc.  Magical
  protections against scrying or eavesdropping can oppose this Charm, but only
  if they cover a whole area, rather than a boundary.  For example, a Privacy
  Veil (Oadenol's Codex, p. 31) would be ineffective, since it hampers those
  listening through a doorway, whereas an Exalt using this Charm is already
  listening from both sides of the doorway.

  TODO
  
  Using this Charm, one of the Traveling Sailsmen can borrow the senses of a
  succession of beings.  At the point at which the Charm is activated, the
  character must be able to identify the initial target through at least one
  sense, not necessarily sight.  From that point on, the character can observe
  through any of the target's senses, so long as it remains within (Essence)
  miles.  Furthermore, the character can reflexively shift his awareness to
  any other being which the current target can identify, by spending a further
  1 mote of Essence.
  
  When the Charm is activated, and whenever the character attempts to move to
  a new target, the players of the character and the new target make an
  opposed (Awareness + Essence) roll.  The player must obtain at least one
  success for the hop to take effect.  A tie or failure leaves the character's
  senses in the same place as before.  If the player fails and the new target
  is an Exalt, that target may makes a reflexive Awareness roll, difficulty 3,
  to notice that someone was attempting to ride his senses.  If he is somehow
  able to find the source of the effect, it will appear to be coming from
  wherever the Exalt's senses are currently based, i.e., possibly an existing
  subject of the effect.
  
  The concentration required to read another's senses puts the character at a
  -2 internal penalty to be aware of his own surroundings.  He can move at
  most half his normal walking speed, and any actions other than movement will
  cause him to miss details from the borrowed senses.  Note that the character
  gains any benefits of unusual senses which the current target has or
  activates, but is limited to his own understanding to interpret those
  impressions.  He cannot use any Charms through the target.

  TODO
  
  Activating this Charm, the Exalt focuses her attention on a single point, be
  it real or imagined--for example, a candle flame.  As long as she maintains
  her commitment of attention and motes then, for the purposes of regaining
  motes of Essence, she is regarded as "at ease" when undertaking strenuous
  activity (regaining four motes per hour) and "completely relaxed" when at
  ease (for eight motes per hour).  The rate at which she regains Essence,
  from rest and all other sources, is multiplied by ([Essence + 1] รท 2)
  rounded up.  Additionally, she may roll to regain Willpower once every (25 รท
  Essence) hours.  However, the focus required to enhance her recuperation in
  this way imposes a -4 internal penalty on all actions.

  This Charm cannot be used while the character is sleeping or otherwise
  unconscious, and is incompatible with the Charms or other actions which
  require the senses to be focused elsewhere, e.g., Holographic Perception
  Praxis.

  TODO
  
  This Charm allows the Exalt to impose part or all of his own perceptions on
  the target.  At the point at which the Charm is activated, the character
  must be able to identify the target through at least one sense, not
  necessarily sight.  Thereafter the effect is maintained as long as the
  target can still be sensed or remains within (Essence x 100) yards.
  
  The character may pick out any objects or creatures he can percieve, or even
  general aspects of his own external or internal senses (darkness, nausea
  etc.), to apply to the target's senses.  In the case of objects or
  creatures, he may cause them to appear anywhere around the target, though he
  cannot control their apparent behaviour, unless he can control the actual
  behaviour of the original.
  
  The conentration required to transfer perceptions in this way puts the
  character at a -2 internal penalty to all actions which require use of the
  senses, as long as he maintains the illusion.  Since this Charm constitutes
  unnatural mental influence, it may be resisted as such, and activating it
  gains the character a point of Hodge.

  Those who are a Law Unto Themselves choose their own state of mind and
  heart, though they may accept another's viewpoint if it suits them.
  
  This Charm may be activated whenever the character is subject to a hostile
  Illusion or Emotion effect, imposed by another being, which she could resist
  in her current state.  Instead of resisting she thoroughly accepts it and,
  in doing so, strengthens her own will.  She immediately regains as many
  points of temporary Willpower as she would need to have spent to resist the
  effect.  She may not take any action herself to throw off the effect until
  as may scenes have elapsed as points of Willpower she would have had to
  spend, although external effects might work against it.

  She may be prevented from acquiescing by other effects.  Influence is deemed
  hostile if the character believes that there is at least a good chance that
  acquiescing to it will be harmful to her values, goals or interests.  A
  character cannot apply this Charm's effect to beneficial or neutral mental
  influence.

  At Awareness 3+ this Charm can also be applied to Compulsion or Servitude
  effects, and to fantasies employed in Shaping Combat.  At Essence 4+, if the
  Willpower regained would take her over her permanent Willpower total, she
  may use those excess points to pay toward any Charms activated in a Combo
  with this Charm, or any other effects reflexively activated in the same
  tick, provided that they do not involve resisting or avoiding the influence.
  After that tick, the excess points are lost.
  
  Use of this Charm does not affect the character's Hodge or Podge rating.
