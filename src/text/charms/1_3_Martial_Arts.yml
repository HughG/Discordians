  The Children of Eris are not chosen for being disposed to great heights or
  depths of spirit and achievement--they are not inherently heroes or
  horrors--and they do not have their own Hero style of martial arts.  In this
  field as in all others, though, they are adept at adopting some tricks from
  whichever sources of inspiration suit them.  They are able to learn Sidereal
  Martial Arts, and have ways to take on the styles of others, or make any
  style uniquely their own.

  An Erisian Martial Artist must still find a teacher to instruct her in any
  given style, except that she may always learn the Quicksilver Hand of Dreams
  Style without a teacher.  Of note is a peculiar interaction between this
  style and the Discordian condition: if a being would forget the character
  due both to use of a Charm of that style, and to the activation of her
  Recumbent Destiny, that target instead clearly remembers the character--or,
  perhaps, forgets to forget her.

  The greatest of sifus are prepared even when they are unprepared; they do
  not move from rest to fighting stance, because the two are one for them.
  Among the Ignorant Children, even the youngest may learn this truth.
  
  The character can activate this Charm whenever a Join Battle roll is called
  for.  It adds (Essence) in dice to his roll and, if any other participants
  roll higher, he nonetheless acts on tick 0.

  A martial artist can do great damage with his bare hands, and more using
  the weapons with which he has honed his skill, but the Voices Whistling are
  insouciantly ready to turn any handy object into a deadly weapon.
  
  This Charm allows the character to reflexively pick up and arm himself with
  any nearby object which roughly fits the shape of a form weapon for some
  style he knows.  The object can be used as a mundane weapon of the
  appropriate type, for Martial Arts attacks and defense, without any
  penalties due to it being an improvised weapon.

  An unattuned artifact weapon can be used but this raises the Charmâ€™s cost to
  5 motes, and requires a feat of Strength with a difficulty equal to twice
  the Strength minimum required to wield it if it were attuned. The character
  gains no magical material bonuses for this but, if he wields the weapon
  continuously for the scene, he may choose to immediately attune it at the
  end of the scene, paying the appropriate cost.

  If the character is disarmed, he can reflexively pay 1 mote to re-activate
  this Charm for another weapon, which is immediately readied, provided one is
  within reach.

  The hand of the martial arts expert is empty not only because it holds no
  weapon, but because it is poised, ready to act in whatever way is required.
  Going beyond such mundane teachings, the Erisian martial artist realises
  that the only true empty hand is one which is not there at all.
  
  This Charm supplements a Martial Arts attack, the character sending her
  limbs slicing through Elsewhere to strike distant foes.  She adds twice her
  Dash distance to the range of the attack, and her attack gains the Reach
  tag, while her target suffers a -1 external penalty to his DVs.

  Masters and Grand-masters spend decades perfecting many forms, but few truly
  understand how to move beyond learning a form, to /being/ the form.

  One of the Law who has learned this Charm can use any Form-type Charms she
  knows, without treating that use as a Charm activation, by spending a point
  of Willpower in addition to the Charm's normal cost.  She may still have
  only one Form-type Charm active at any given time.
  
  An additional benefit, though less frequently useful, is that the character
  can easily switch between forms.  If she ends one Form-type Charm and
  activates another in same tick, she can use the motes spent on the Form she
  abandons to pay towards the new Form-type Charm.  If the new Charm costs
  less than the previous one, the extra motes are not refunded, but must be
  regained later as normal.  This does not require the expenditure of
  Willpower (unless she wants to adopt the new Form without a Charm
  activation).

  Wise men and babies alike think that all things are one.  In combat, then,
  we all strike only at ourselves, and even the most seasoned sage is wearied
  by this realisation at times.  But if all is one, where can one find respite
  from this?  Why, in Limbo, of course, where there are no things!
  
  The Whistling Voice can only use this Charm while he has a Form-type Charm
  active.  When this Charm is activated, he retreats momentarily to gather
  himself -- not into a meditative state, but into Elsewhere.  If invoked in
  response to an attack, it perfectly defends against that attack, unless it
  is unblockable or undodgeable.  (Together, the requirement that a Form-type
  Charm be active, and the imperfection of defense against unblockable and
  undodgeable attacks constitute a unique Flaw of Invulnerability.)  In those
  cases, the character may suffer damage and other effects from the attack,
  but still vanishes immediately.  This means that, for instance, further
  attacks in a flurry cannot target him.  On the other hand, the character may
  do nothing until the tick on which he reappears; indeed, no ticks pass for
  him, which may be relevant to the duration of some effects.  Counterattacks
  are delayed until the character reappears, meaning he takes that one
  additional action on his next action tick--provided the attacker has not
  moved out of range.
  
  The character's anima flares to the 8-10 mote level on the tick when he
  disappears, and again on the tick when he reappears, unless of course it was
  already flaring at a higher level; if not, it returns to its previous level
  on the following tick.  If something else specificially moves into the
  character's previous location while he is absent, he reappears at the
  nearest point at which there is space for him.  Depending on the
  storyteller's whim, this could leave him with his back to his opponent.

  TODO
  
  On purchasing this Charm, the character selects a Martial Arts style from
  which she has mastered a Form-type Charm.  Thereafter, she may develop
  custom Martial Arts Charms which extend that style.  The first such Charm
  costs half the normal number of experience points, and may be learned at the
  same time as this Charm, without any additional training time.  The
  character may purchase this Charm up to (Essence) times, allowing her to
  extend a number of different styles.  Note that this Charm does not allow
  the character to learn Martial Arts Charms from other Exalted types which
  extend their own Hero styles.  Nothing prevents them from developing their
  own similar custom Charms, although they are likely to be slightly more
  expensive or less effective.

  TODO
  
  On purchasing this Charm, the character selects a Martial Arts Hero style
  from which she has mastered a Form-type Charm.  Thereafter, she may access
  the Enhanced benefits of that style by activating its Form-type Charm and
  paying an additional point of Willpower, which must be committed for the
  scene.  However, this ability is only available while the character
  maintains a fully-committed highly positive Intimacy towards the type of
  being to which the style belongs.  If she allows that Intimacy to lapse, or
  it is somehow suppressed, removed, or has its tone altered to something less
  than laudatory, this effect cannot be activated, and indeed terminates if it
  has already been activated in the scene, releasing the Willpower commitment.
  Once the situation has been rectified, the character must pay the cost again
  to reactivate it if desired.

  *[TODO: Is the next para worth it?]*

  Alchemical Exalted do not have their own Hero style, but Erisians do not
  allow this inconvenient fact to limit their meddling.  A character may
  choose to learn this Charm for any non-Hero style, in which case paying the
  extra cost causes any form weapons to become extensions of the character's
  own body for the duration, making it impossible to disarm the character
  without specific Crippling effects or similar magic.

  TODO
  
  This Charm allows the character to create and use prayer strips to use the
  student and elder sutras for any Sidereal martial arts style from which he
  has mastered, respectively, the Form-type Charm or the entire style.
  Unfortuneately the maidens are not inherently disposed to listen to the
  prayers of Eris' children, so this facility is unreliable.  Casting the
  relevant prayer strip aloft, the character rolls his (Essence + temporary
  Willpower).  A single success is enough to coax or trick the Incarnae into
  allowing the prayer strip to activate, and some choose to spend a point of
  Willpower to guarantee this success, rather than taking a chance.  Failure
  sees the prayer strip drift to the ground, whence it can be retrieved with a
  miscellaneous action.  A botch leads to some "chance" breeze or similar bad
  luck wafting the prayer strip out of reach--beyond a single Move action, but
  no further than a single Dash action.  In either case, some other character
  might snatch it up, or other harm befall it, before the character can
  retrieve it.
