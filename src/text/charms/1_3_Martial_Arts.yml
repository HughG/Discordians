  The Children of Eris are not chosen for being disposed to great heights or
  depths of spirit and achievement--they are not inherently heroes or
  horrors--and they do not have their own Hero style of martial arts.  In this
  field as in all others, though, they are adept at adopting some tricks from
  whichever sources of inspiration suit them.  They are able to learn Sidereal
  Martial Arts, and have ways to take on the styles of others, or make any
  style uniquely their own.

  An Erisian Martial Artist must still find a teacher to instruct her in any
  given style, except that she may always learn the Quicksilver Hand of Dreams
  Style without a teacher.  Of note is a peculiar interaction between this
  style and the Discordian condition: if a being would forget the character
  due both to use of a Charm of that style, and to the activation of her
  Recumbent Destiny, that target instead clearly remembers the character--or,
  perhaps, forgets to forget her.

  The greatest of sifus are prepared even when they are unprepared; they do
  not move from rest to fighting stance, because the two are one for them.
  Among the Ignorant Children, even the youngest may learn this truth.
  
  The character can activate this Charm whenever he is subject to an attack
  which is initially unexpected, even if some other effect removes the
  unexpected quality.  He is able to take his next action on the same tick as
  the attack, even if this would effectively reduce the Speed of his previous
  action to 1.  This Charm does not by itself remove the unexpected quality
  from the attack.  If the surprise attack is one which requires a Join Battle
  roll, then the character acts on tick zero, and does not roll.

  A martial artist can do great damage with his bare hands, and more using
  the weapons with which he has honed his skill, but the Voices Whistling are
  insouciantly ready to turn any handy object into a deadly weapon.
  
  This Charm allows the character to reflexively pick up and arm himself with
  any nearby object which roughly fits the size of a form weapon for some
  style he knows.  The object can be used as a mundane weapon of the
  appropriate type, for Martial Arts attacks and defense, without any
  penalties due to it being an improvised weapon.

  An unattuned artifact form weapon can instead be used, but this raises the
  Charmâ€™s cost to 5 motes, and requires a feat of Strength with a difficulty
  equal to twice the Strength minimum required to wield it if it were attuned.
  The character gains no magical material bonuses for this but, if he wields
  the weapon continuously for the scene, he may choose to immediately attune
  it at the end of the scene, paying the appropriate cost.

  If the character is disarmed, he can reflexively pay 1 mote to re-activate
  this Charm for another weapon, which is immediately readied, provided one is
  within reach.

  The hand of the martial arts expert is empty not only because it holds no
  weapon, but because it is poised, ready to act in whatever way is required.
  Going beyond such mundane teachings, the Erisian martial artist realises
  that the only true empty hand is one which is not there at all.
  
  This Charm supplements a Martial Arts attack, the character sending her
  limbs slicing through Elsewhere to strike distant foes.  She adds twice her
  Dash distance to the range of the attack, and her attack gains the Reach
  tag, while her target suffers a -1 external penalty to his DVs.  The
  character cannot effectively make a grapple attack with this Charm, since
  her limbs extend to their new location only for an instant.  She can,
  however, use it for Defend Other actions at range.

  Masters and Grand-masters spend decades perfecting many forms, but few truly
  understand how to move beyond learning a form, to _being_ the form.

  One of the Law who has learned this Charm can use any Martial Arts Form-Type
  Charm she knows in a Combo with any other Charms with the Combo-Basic or
  Combo-OK keywords, by spending a point of Willpower in addition to the
  Charm's normal cost.  (Effectively, this gives the Form-Type Charm the
  Combo-OK keyword.)  She may still have only one Form-type Charm active at
  any given time.
  
  An additional benefit, though less frequently useful, is that the character
  can easily switch between forms.  If she ends one Form-type Charm and
  activates another in same tick, she can use the motes spent on the Form she
  abandons to pay towards the new Form-type Charm.  If the new Charm costs
  less than the previous one, the extra motes are not refunded, but must be
  regained later as normal.  This does not require the expenditure of
  Willpower (unless she wants to adopt the new Form without a Charm
  activation).

  Wise men and babies alike think that all things are one.  In combat, then,
  we all strike only at ourselves, and even the most seasoned sage is wearied
  by this realization at times.  But if all is one, where can one find respite
  from this?  Why, in Limbo, of course, where there are no things!
  
  The Whistling Voice can only use this Charm while he has a Form-type Charm
  active.  When this Charm is activated, he retreats momentarily to gather
  himself--not into a meditative state, but into Elsewhere.  If invoked in
  response to an attack, it perfectly defends against that attack, unless it
  is unblockable or undodgeable.  (Together, the requirement that a Form-type
  Charm be active, and the imperfection of defense against unblockable and
  undodgeable attacks constitute a unique Flaw of Invulnerability.)  Vanishing
  in this way also forfeits any opportunity the character would have had to
  launch a Counterattack.

  TODO
  
  On purchasing this Charm, the character selects a Martial Arts style from
  which she has mastered a Form-type Charm.  Thereafter, she may develop
  custom Discordian Charms--based on the Martial Arts Ability--which extend
  that style.  The character may purchase this Charm up to (Essence) times,
  allowing her to extend a number of different styles.  Note that this Charm
  does not allow the character to learn native Martial Arts Charms from other
  Exalted types which extend their own Hero styles.  Nothing prevents them
  from developing their own similar custom Charms, although they are likely to
  be slightly more expensive or less effective.  Charms developed in this way
  are not part of any Martial Arts style, and have the Native Keyword, so can
  only be learned by other Discordians who have purchased this Charm for the
  same Martial Arts style.  Additionally, all Charms developed using a given
  purchase of this Charm have that purchase as a pre-requisite, which may be
  relevant in Divisional Realignment.

  TODO
  
  On purchasing this Charm, the character selects a Martial Arts Hero style
  from which she has mastered a Form-type Charm.  Thereafter, she may access
  the Enhanced benefits of that style by spending an additional 5 motes when
  activating its Form-type Charm, which must be committed for the scene.
  However, this ability is only available while the character maintains a
  fully-committed highly positive Intimacy towards the type of being to which
  the style belongs.  If she allows that Intimacy to lapse, or it is somehow
  suppressed, removed, or has its tone altered to something less than
  laudatory, this effect cannot be activated, and indeed terminates if it has
  already been activated in the scene, releasing the mote commitment.  Once
  the situation has been rectified, the character must pay the cost again to
  reactivate it if desired.

  TODO
  
  This Charm allows the character to create and use prayer strips to use the
  student and elder sutras for any Sidereal martial arts style from which he
  has mastered, respectively, the Form-type Charm or the entire style.
  Unfortuneately the maidens are not inherently disposed to listen to the
  prayers of Eris' children, so this facility is unreliable.  Casting the
  relevant prayer strip aloft, the character rolls his (Essence + temporary
  Willpower).  A single success is enough to coax or trick the Incarnae into
  allowing the prayer strip to activate, and some choose to spend a point of
  Willpower to guarantee this success, rather than taking a chance.  Failure
  sees the prayer strip drift to the ground, whence it can be retrieved with a
  miscellaneous action.  A botch leads to some ``chance'' breeze or similar
  bad luck wafting the prayer strip out of reach--beyond a single Move action,
  but no further than a single Dash action.  In either case, some other
  character might snatch it up, or other harm befall it, before the character
  can retrieve it.  Furthermore, unlike genuine Sidereal prayer strips, the
  counterfeit does not gain any magical protection when activated--it cannot
  dodge or block attacks, and even a single level of bashing damage will
  destroy it.  The character may take other steps to protect it, of course.

  This Charm is the Erisian version of the one known to Solars as ``Swallowing
  the Lotus Root'', which allows learning of Terrestrial Martial Arts Charms
  at half the normal experience cost, and removes the surcharge for
  elementally aspected Styles.  Note that unlearning this Charm during
  <<Divisional_Realignment>> means that the character must re-pay any savings
  made on Terrestrial Martial Arts learned up till that point, which may put
  her into experience debt.
