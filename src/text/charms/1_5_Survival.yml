  Most find comfort behind the ordered walls of civilization, but the Daughter
  of Eris smiles and laughs among the chaos of the wildest places.  This Charm
  supplements a roll to resist environmental damage.  It allows the character
  to add (Survival รท 2) successes to the (Stamina + Resistance) roll, and
  increases the magnitude of the time period until the next check (where the
  orders of magnitude are: action, minute, hour, day).

  Strange snakes are proverbially said to lie with their forked tongues.
  Exalts, being human, generally have legs, and Discordians choose at times to
  lie with their feet.  (This differs from Lunar Exalted who are, of course,
  more likely just to lie with a snake.)
  
  This Charm supplements a roll to evade pursuit, laying false trails and
  making the tracks of the Whistling Voice lead into those of other creatures.
  It allows the character to add (Essence รท 2) successes when contesting his
  (Wits + Survival) against a pursuer's (Perception + Survival).  If the
  pursuer is sucessfully shaken off, he or she will not simply find a trail
  gone cold, but will be led to some other local creature, which may or may
  not be hostile.

  The balance between order and chaos is closely linked to the balance between
  predator and prey, nourishment and destruction.  Thus the nature of the
  Ignorant Children appeals to ignorant beasts.
  
  This Charm supplements a roll to find animals, for food or any other
  purpose, not by increasing the hunter's skill but by drawing animals (or
  other local creatures of equivalent intelligence and power) to him.  It
  allows the character to add ([the higher of Charisma or Appearance] รท 2)
  successes to the (Intelligence + Survival) roll for hunting.  If the hunt is
  successful, the hunter will find that a number of other animals, equal in
  Magnitude to (Essence รท 2), have also been drawn in, though they will be of
  various indigenous types, not necessarily the kind hunted.  The character
  may thus acquire additional food, or may have to fight local creatures to
  keep his prize.

  The Most Beautiful do not deign to have their fair skin lashed by
  sandstorms, or a lock brushed out of place in an avalanche.  This Charm
  allows the character to ignore all damage to themselves and their equipment
  from any one type of environmental damage for one scene.  The environmental
  effect must be one which would normally have harmed the character, for this
  Charm to apply.  This Charm is not applicable to poisons unless they are a
  pervasive part of the environment, e.g., toxic gases around a volcano.
  
  Any number of times during the Charm's duration, he may pay a further 2
  motes and concentrate for a Miscellaneous Action, to heal a single health
  level by treating the effect as an additional Erisian element.  This does
  not count as a Charm use.  As with the Resistance Charm known as Erisian
  Elemental Rejuvenation, the character is Inactive during that action.  He
  may return to normal reflexively at any time during that action, e.g., for
  reflexive self-defense, but that will disrupt concentration and lose the
  healing benefits.  The motes will still be spent in this case.  Also, this
  power diverts all healing energy to the Exalt alone, so any mundane
  equipment they carry may be damaged during that action.

  Those who are a Law Unto Themselves do not have quite the primitive, brutal
  sympathy with other beings which the Lunar Exalted carry in their blood, but
  they can fake it for a while.
  
  With this Charm the character may take on the appearance of any creature of
  animal-level intelligence, native to the surrounding environment.  The
  character does not gain any physical abilities or traits of the creature so
  mimicked, but will be accepted as what he appears to be by any normal
  denizen of that habitat.  Resisting this unnatural mental influence normally
  requires spending 3 points of Willpower.  Those with magical nature or
  powers which give them reason to suspect it (e.g., Lunars, those able to see
  Essence flows etc.) may resist by spending a single point of Willpower.  If
  anyone successfully resists, the character gains a point of Hodge (at most
  one per scene).  Use of any Obvious Charms, or exhibiting any abilities or
  behaviors which are inappropriate to the animal, automatically ends the
  illusion, regardless of the presence or absence of witnesses.
  
  The character may shift form once per scene, for an additional expenditure
  (not committment) of 2 motes of Essence.  This requires a Miscellaneous
  Action but does not count as Charm use.

  Where others search intently for those they wish to track, the Discordian
  Exalt harnesses the twin powers of confusion and laziness, to cause her very
  surroundings to bring the quarry to her.
  
  This Charm supplements an attempt to pursue some target, temporarily
  applying subtle Shaping to the environment around said target, to confuse
  them and herd them towards the Lawbreaker.  This imposes an external penalty
  equal to the character's Essence on attempts at evasion by the subject of
  pursuit.  Even if other effects prevent the character from catching her
  quarry, this Charm may delay its outright escape, if it cannot gain an
  advantage of three accumulated successes.  The alterations to the
  environment make the path of pursuit more obvious in general, giving a bonus
  +2 dice to any others attempting to follow the same quarry (or, indeed, the
  character) for the next day.  The terrain over which pursuit occurs need not
  actually be earth: even in the Deep Wyld, this Charm makes bizarre but
  effective changes to the target's surroundings.
  
  A being is a valid target for this Charm if the character can see (or
  otherwise sense) them directly, or has a trail to begin with, which is
  sufficient to allow a roll to track them.  Effects which prevent Shaping
  from affecting the target directly make no difference to this Charm, since
  it applies to the environment around the target.  Effects which counter
  Shaping in an area around the target reduce the penalties and bonuses of
  this Charm by an amount equal to the difference in Essence between the
  character and the source of the effect, to a minimum of zero.

  ``Idealism lives with rules. Realism lives with rocks.'' - Professor
  Ignotium P. Ignotius.  Breaking the normal rules of reality, the Blessed of
  Eris truly becomes one with her surroundings.
  
  Activating this Charm, the character merges herself with the nature of the
  immediate environment, creating a perfect camouflage: in the East she might
  appear as a tree, in the West a patch of floating seaweed, and so on.  Her
  Essence signature, and that of the Charm itself, are also transformed, so
  that any attempt to detect her in this manner requires a contested roll of
  (Appearance + Survival) versus the observer's (Perception + Occult), with an
  external penalty equal to the character's Survival.  Attacks or
  environmental damage will only affect the character if it would affect the
  corresponding environment--fire would damage a tree, but not a rock.
  
  While under the effects of this Charm, the character is regarded as
  Inactive, although she is not actually unconscious and retains her full
  faculties of observation.  She needs no sustenance beyond what her new form
  would require.  She cannot voluntarily move, but will be carried along if
  her surroundings move.  She may choose to end the effects of this Charm at
  any time and act normally on the immediately following tick.  This Charm is
  not applicable in artificial structures (e.g., buildings), unless they are
  in some way the natural environment, as within the body of Autochthon.  It
  is, however, applicable in realms other than Creation: within Malfeas, for
  instance, the Silent Wind is itself part of the environment, so the
  character may avoid its effects by choosing to be swept along as part of it.
  
  Use of this Charm gains the character a point of Podge.

  Sometimes the confusion of Recumbent Destiny is not enough to get a
  Discordian out of trouble; or, he needs to lie low until exactly the right
  moment to work his Chaos.  In such cases, the concealment of this powerful
  Charm can be just what is needed.

  Activating this Charm, the Anchorite suffuses his being into an expanse of
  land, becoming immaterial and present at every point within the area.  He
  remains distantly aware of goings-on within the region while hidden, and can
  name up to (Essence) trigger conditions when activating this Charm, which
  will draw his attention more clearly to certain situations, to give him the
  option of ending his concealment.  The trigger conditions must be things
  which he could observe with his senses--natural or magically enhanced--and
  understand.  For example, a trigger of ``a wealthy merchant passes through''
  will activate if and only if someone comes along who _appears_ to be a
  wealthy merchant.

  The Charm functions in any realm of reality, although using it within
  Autochthonia or Malfeas has a slight risk of drawing the attention of the
  Maker or the Yozi, if only subconsciously.  The character can choose any
  area up to (Survival x Essence x Essence) square miles, and may leave gaps
  within this region.  In the Wyld, he can spread himself across (Essence - 3)
  waypoints, plus the journeys joining them.  He cannot include spaces warded
  against immaterial beings, though he may spread himself around them.  If an
  area is warded after the Charm is acivated, it is cut out of the Charm's
  effect area until the ward is removed.  If the ward covers the entire area
  of the Charm, the ward ends.  Linear barriers, rather than area wards, do
  not cause these problems.

  While hidden, the character needs no sustenance, and cannot be harmed unless
  explicitly targeted with magic.  He can apply his senses as if he were
  present at any location within the region, and can change this location as a
  miscellaneous action, but his awareness is at a -4 external penalty.  If any
  of the trigger conditions happens within the Charm's range, however, he will
  be instantly aware of the fact, and can observe the relevant location
  without this penalty for one scene.  He cannot observe areas warded against
  scrying, though linear barriers are not a problem, since he can move his
  awareness to either side of such a barrier.  He may be able to observe areas
  warded against immaterial beings by the simple expedient of ``standing''
  outside and looking in.

  Aside from watching, the character can activate non-Obvious Charms which do
  not rely on his physical form, and can use artifacts which do not rely on
  his or their physical form.  He can use Numerology but not Sorcery.  He can
  also cause the environment he inhabits to act in cosmetic ways equivalent to
  the normal proceses of least gods and the like.  This has no mechanical
  effect by itself but allows him some facility to stunt actions.  He cannot
  Join Battle, Debate or War except during the scene and at the location of a
  trigger event, and even then he is limited to the above actions, and cannot
  make physical or social attacks.  He can end the Charm at any time as a
  miscellaneous action, and may appear in his previous form at any point
  within its area when he does so.

  Detecting the character as an immaterial being is impossible without
  magic--the natural senses of other immaterial beings are not enough--and
  even then is done at an external penalty equal to his ([Stamina or
  Appearance] + Survival).  Success will not find an individual being, rather
  a spread-out presence.  Indeed, unless observers know what they are looking
  for, they may interpret this as some form of magic, Wyld taint, or other
  strange effect.  However, what they see will be enough to target him with
  effects which apply to an area, or are not location-related.  Detecting the
  ongoing activation of this Charm over the area, as well as any activated in
  a Combo with it, is impossible without a perfect effect.  Even then, this
  Charm forces a roll-off against the character's ([Stamina or Appearance] +
  Survival + Essence).

  At Essence 5+, this hiding of self persists even after death.  The
  character's death will not end the Charm's effects and, if the Storyteller
  decides that Discordian Exaltations pass on to new hosts, then the new host
  will not experience the effects of Exaltation, or be aware of his power,
  until the trigger conditions are satisfied.  At such times, the mortal will
  have a vision of the trigger event, and may choose to take on the Exaltion
  offered to him--unknown yet intuitively understood.  When he does so, he may
  also choose to be physically transported to the trigger location or any
  other location within the original area of the Charm, even if it is in
  another realm of reality.  How he survives there and how he gets back
  afterwards are quetions for later.

  Joyful company sustains the soul, and the lone loud voice which is sure of
  its own location can surely find all other things: ``A jug of wine, a leg of
  lamb and thou! / Beside me, whistling in the darkness.''
  
  This Charm replaces the normal Survival roll for route-finding, guaranteeing
  that the character knows the direction of her desired destination and (if
  one exists at all) a passable route towards it, as long as the motes remain
  committed.  The destination must be a specific place known to the character,
  rather than one specified by characteristics (e.g., ``the home of my
  enemy'').  It need not be a place which they have already visited, however.
  
  The route need not be safe, and it may be passable only by means currently
  unavailable to the character, such as sail or flight, or through a gateway
  the character cannot open.  To gain this benefit, the character must
  continually whistle at a reasonably audible volume, giving a -4 penalty to
  all Stealth effects, a -2 penalty to evasion of pursuit, and a -2 penalty to
  communication of all but the simplest of concepts.
  
  The character need not eat, drink or sleep while the whistling continues:
  she will accumulate fatigue penalties as normal but will not die.  A normal
  day of food and rest at the Charm's cessation will restore her to her
  previous level of health.  The character may substitute chanting, humming,
  gesturing wildly or any other similarly obvious and awkward activity.  He
  may simply choose to stop the Charm and then activate it again after rest,
  but there is no guarantee that the same route will be found again.

  The beautiful Chaos which is life must sometimes make a trade-off between
  freedom and security, sacrificing some of its identity to preserve the rest.
  
  This Charm allows other Survival Charms employed by the Anchorite to be
  extended to a group equal in Magnitude to the character's Essence, as long
  as the members focus entirely on a word, phrase or mental image which the
  Priest imparts to them.  This focus prevents the targets from doing anything
  other than physically following the Exalt and carrying out the basics needed
  for survival: hunting, foraging, eating, sleeping, remaining alert for
  predators, and reflexively defending themselves.  This effect constitutes
  unnatural mental influence; in most cases targets will be expected to accept
  it, but nonetheless the character gains a single point of Hodge.  Normal
  animals are assumed to consent unless they are actively hostile towards the
  character.  The effects also extend to objects owned by the targets, if
  applicable.  The motes for this Charm must be committed for as long as the
  other Charm effect(s) which are to be extended.  If this additional
  commitment ends early, the extended effects persist for one scene, after
  which the original Charms revert to applying only to the character himself.
