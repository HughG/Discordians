  The makers of Modern vehicles may see their creations as striving towards
  mechanical perfection but every driver knows that, when the rubber hits the
  road, a hundred unpredictable factors come into play.  The Children of Eris
  get the best from their vehicles when they embrace this conflict.  This
  Charm permanently enhances the Discordian's driving abilities, providing the
  following benefits.

  * Driving at more than half maximum speed requires a piloting roll as
  normal, but the character adds (Drive ÷ 2) automatic successes.  When
  travelling at greater than maximum Speed, this increases to (Drive)
  successes.

  * Any Maneuverability penalties for a vehicle are converted to bonuses.  If
  another effect would reduce such penalties or provide bonuses, it is applied
  after this benefit.

  * The character will never botch a Piloting roll.  Attempts to regain
  control after a failed Piloting roll add (Essence ÷ 2) in automatic
  successes.

  * In a chase, the Hazard gained from a Cunning Maneuver or a Weave action is
  reduced to +0, while that from a Dangerous Maneuver becomes -2.

  *[TODO: fluff]*

  For the rest of the scene in which this Charm is activated, the character
  can pay one mote reflexively to convert up to (Essence ÷ 2) stunt dice to
  automatic successes, for driving-related stunts, or those performed from or
  targeting a vehicle, when they resonate with any one chosen Erisian Element.
  The Charm can be activated for multiple elements concurrently, with each
  activation after the first costing just 2 motes.

  The Storyteller is the arbiter of what count as resonant themes, actions, or
  objects, but some examples are as follows.  *Orange* could cover traffic
  cones and other paraphenalia of construction work, plus typical Meruvian
  taxis and school buses.  *Sweet* describes particularly stylish vehicles, or
  especially compassionate actions.  *Boom* is generally not too hard to find
  in urban environments and car chases.  *Pungent* envrionments exist in
  street-markets, dockyards, and run-down or underground areas.  *Prickle* can
  be present when trailing another vehicle or being followed, taking a
  Stalk/Hide action in a chase, or in minor violations of traffic laws.
  *Dirt* is, as with Boom, widespread in its literal sense, but cars in bus
  lanes or shopping malls are not where they are wanted, and a heavy
  motorcycle roaring past a funeral procession might be regarded as
  distasteful, depending on the deceased.  *Focus* is seen in literally
  unswerving pursuit of a goal or target, disregarding obstacles, and can be
  in Close In actions in a chase.  *Dream* can be seen in attempts at the
  impossible, or sometimes in heedless disregard for safety while attending to
  something else, such as when ploughing through a red light.  *Binding*
  relates to such things as tow ropes, road blocks, wheel clamps, stop signs
  and lights, and so on.

  In the Modern age spirits are hunted and guardian angels largely neglected,
  but Discordians know that each being's world-view can be as important as
  anyone else's.  Activating this Charm draws the guardian angel of a vehicle
  to wakefulness and thereby instils in it an Intimacy of grateful loyalty to
  the character.  For artifact vehicles, he must be the attuned owner for the
  Charm to function, but for mundane vehicles he need not even be the owner.
  This Charm can also call to the inherent energies of plasmic vehicles in the
  Underworld, fantastic conveyances in the Wyld, and so on in other realms.

  The awakened least god is able to help guide its mobile home, which has
  several benefits for the driver.  Piloting rolls for vehicles travelling
  between half maximum and maximum Speed become reflexive.  Going over maximum
  speed requires Piloting rolls as miscellaneous actions, but the
  Maneuverability penalty is reduced to -1, and failure only causes an
  automatic crash for rolls with difficulty 5+.  In a Chase, the driver may
  take an Activate Charm or Attack action as if he were a passenger.  As long
  as the Charm remains active, the vehicle itself applies an external penalty
  equal to the character's (Drive ÷ 2) to all Piloting rolls by anyone else,
  unless the character first gives permission while touching the vehicle.

  Re-activating the Charm in successive scenes costs only 3m.  With Drive 3+
  and Essence 3+, the duration extends to Indefinite, and another benefit is
  provided.  The vehicle can be left unattended with basic instructions, as
  long as the character remains within (Essence x 100) yards.  Instructions
  can be given in person, or by prayer (or other telepathic communication)
  with a difficulty of 2.  In the latter case, the character can use (Drive ÷
  2) in place of Performance if preferred.  Each instruction costs 2 motes.

  * It can unlock only for specific beings, who must previously have touched
  the vehicle while this Charm is active, so that the character can identify
  them to the vehicle.  This personal keying does not prevent attempts to
  Bypass Security and force entry to the vehicle.

  * It can drive off and maintain a regular or random holding pattern within
  radius of the character, at the character's instruction or when unauthorized
  beings attempt to enter or otherwise interfere with it.

  * It can drive towards the character by the most direct safe route.

  *[TODO: fluff]*

  (Like Ride_brw, but instead of drawing on the awareness of living beings, it
  taps into that of the guardian angels of non-artifact objects.  Rather than
  leading a procession, the character drives a circuit of the area, stopping
  to provide respectful attention and interaction to at least one significant
  example of each type of object whose spirits he wishes to call on.  The
  character will thereafter become aware of certain events as perceived by the
  least gods of all instances of such objects within the area.  At Storyteller
  discretion, the maximum warded area may be reduced to as little as (Essence
  x 10) square miles in urban areas and other places dense with complex
  physical objects, as the magic of the Charm can sustain a connection with
  only so many spirits.  This Charm alerts the character to any being that the
  least gods regard as alien, foreign, not belonging, or any event that
  strikes them as particularly unusual.  Quite what the least gods of urban
  objects regard as noteworthy is up to the Storyteller, who must also
  consider their limited perceptive abilities as compared to natural animals.)

  *[TODO: fluff]*
  
  This Charm enhances attempts by a driving character to detect dangerous
  moving objects or static hazards in the environment through which the
  vehicle is travelling--for example, roadblocks and diversions, swing bridges
  soon to open, vehicles on a collision course from a side street, and so on.
  Vehicles in general will not register as hazards unless they are about to do
  something clearly dangerous, or can easily be identified as belonging to
  some hostile category by the character's senses, such as police cars if the
  character has done something illegal, or helicopters overhead if they are
  attempting to avoid notice.

  The range of this sense is (Essence) miles.  It does not give a clear image
  of any objects, but will normally be able to distinguish at least between
  buildings and other fixed constructions, vehicles, and natural creatures, on
  the basis of their rough shape.  Anything down to the size of a human will
  be noticeable, including its approximate location, speed and heading.  As
  well as providing a sense of nearby dangers, this Charm adds (Drive ÷ 2)
  dice to any Piloting or other Drive roll related to covered hazards in the
  area, or attempts to find the best route through traffic.  This bonus also
  applies to attempts to oppose Stealth effects used by beings or vehicles
  moving within the covered radius.  It does not apply to any which teleport,
  move immaterially (unless the character can also sense such things), or
  otherwise do not traverse the covered space.  In a chase, external Hazards
  which fall into the described categories are reduced by (Essence ÷ 2).

  (The vehicle jumps through a pair of ephemeral Elsewhere portals,
  re-appearing at any point within (Essence x 2) times its normal per-tick
  movement distance, travelling in any desired direction.  In a chase, this
  adds (Drive) automatic successes to the (Dexterity + Drive) roll to reach
  the end of the leg.  The brave or foolhardy may use this to jump through
  solid objects, into mid-air, and so on.)

  *[TODO: fluff]* (Like a mixture of Sail_cop and Sail_sbtw.)

  When a Discordian driver activates this Charm, his vehicle begins to hop
  briefly through Elsewhere from time to time, allowing it to cover distance
  as if it were travelling at its maximum speed, but requiring Piloting rolls
  as if it were travelling below half maximum in a straight line.  The driver
  need have no regard for traffic, nor vehicle-sized obstacles, nor turns, and
  the vehicle makes no more noise than it would at normal speeds.

  The vehicle also automatically takes its hops when it would be noticed by
  any active or passive observing system, or any being actively seeking or
  pursuing it, up to and including means on the level of the Loom of Fate.
  This reduces successes on any attempts to notice or track it to zero, after
  all modifiers have been applied.  If this effect is opposed by a perfect
  perception effect, add the character's Essence in automatic successes to the
  opposed roll.
