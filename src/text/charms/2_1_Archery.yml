  This Charm, applied in Step 1 of attack resolution, summons the Erisian's
  Archery weapon to his hand, from any point up to (Essence x 2) yards away.
  The weapon must be one which the character owns.  It travels via Elsewhere,
  meaning that most bindings, even magical ones, will not prevent it from
  returning to his hand.  The character may use this Charm to reflexively
  ready a weapon and attack in the same action.
  
  The character may also apply this Charm to any reusable ammunition from an
  attack, summoning it back to his hand either before or after raw damage is
  calculated.  If the ammunition is summoned back before the damage
  calculation, no damage is done and no poison or other contact effects apply,
  but the target may still take advantage of any counterattacks available.  If
  the ammunition is specifically destroyed, it cannot be summoned back.
  
  A second purchase at Archery 3 and Essence 3 allows the character to use the
  Charm with an Indefinite duration, applied to a weapon, suspending it in
  Elsewhere.  It will remain there as long as the motes remain committed.
  When they are reflexively released, it will appear in his hand, or fall to
  the ground at his feet if both hands are occupied.

  It is hard to defend against things you cannot see or touch, even if you
  know they are coming.  The Soft and Steady Hand sends her shot on an
  esoteric curve through Elsewhere, reappearing at exactly the right time to
  strike the target.
  
  This Charm supplements an Archery attack in a number of ways.  It applies a
  -2 external penalty to the defender's DVs, unless he or she can somehow see
  into Elsewhere.  It causes the attack to ignore any Hardness or soak due to
  armour or any similar protections beyond the target's own skin, and to
  ignore DV bonuses due to cover.  It does not cause the attack to ignore
  natural soak, or soak added by Charms.  It furthermore effectively allows
  shots to pass through solid objects, though some magical wards may prevent
  this.  If the character cannot otherwise percieve the target through any
  such objects, the attack will suffer a -4 external penalty--as severe as
  blindness--unless some other effect improves the situation.

  This Charm supplements a character's Archery attack by suspending it within
  Elsewhere immediately after he launches it, ready to be resumed at a later
  point in time.  Step 1 of attack resolution is carried out, including any
  expenditure of motes for other Charms, but without naming a target.  The
  arrow, jet of flame or other projectile is fired but vanishes.  It remains
  Elsewhere as long as the character maintains the commitment of motes for
  this Charm, plus the mote cost of all other Charms, if used in a Combo.  The
  character can store at most (Essence) projectiles in Elsewhere using this
  Charm.
  
  The motes may be released at any later point as a reflexive action,
  including as a counterattack, causing the attack to be resumed.  This does
  not count as a Charm use, and need not be in the same battle, allowing him
  to attack without readying a weapon.  The character need not be wielding the
  weapon at the time, though he can still only choose a target which would be
  valid at the point when the motes are released.  A slight disturbance in the
  air as the projectile reappears means that this Charm does not in itself
  make the attack unexpected.

  Even things that go wrong can go right sometimes.  With the Fletcher's
  Rejoinder, an Exalt's mischievous will is extended into her projectile,
  allowing attacks which miss to loop around and return for a second attack.
  
  This Charm enhances an Archery attack such that, if the attack fails because
  the arrow missed (whether due to the attacker's inaccuracy or the target
  dodging), or was deflected by Hardness or a parry, then the projectile
  returns, allowing the same attack to be re-rolled on the following tick,
  with no speed cost or DV penalty.  If the attack fails because of the
  target's soak, the arrow falls harmlessly to the ground and the Charm is
  ineffective; similarly if the arrow is otherwise destroyed or its flight
  specifically ended on the first attack.  If the first attack was part of a
  Combo, the second attack may optionally have the same Combo applied, with
  the cost paid again.  This Charm itself may be used on the second attack,
  alone or as part of a Combo, enabling third and further attacks, but each
  attack beyond the second is at a cumulative -1 penalty to accuracy and
  damage.
  
  Some Discordians have been known to use this Charm and deliberately miss on
  their first attack.  In this case, the second attack is treated similarly to
  an ambush: roll the attacker's (Dexterity + Archery) against the defender's
  (Wits + Awareness), with appropriate penalties or bonuses depending on the
  defender's wariness.  Failure gives the defender a Dodge and Parry DV of 0.
  However, if the defender has already seen this technique used in the same
  story, they gain a +2 bonus to the contested roll.

  TODO
  
  This Charm allows the Moonlight Lyre to use any vaguely suitable small
  objects as ammunition for her bow, flame piece or other Archery weapon.  The
  effects of any standard type of arrow may be reproduced, though the
  Storyteller may apply bonuses or penalties depending on materials available.
  Dust, grains, pebbles and so on may be used as firewand ammunition, but the
  range will be halved unless the substance is easily flammable, and the
  damage will be be bashing, not lethal, unless it is particularly hard and
  sharp.  Reloading with easily reachable objects from her surroundings will
  take the character no longer than normal for the weapon in question.  The
  Storyteller may impose a Speed penalty, or require extra actions to reload,
  if suitable objects are harder to reach, however.
  
  Unless other effects apply, the improvised items of ammunition must be
  normal, physical objects, though they might be magical objects.  They must
  be of approximately normal size and weight for the weapon in question, but
  they need not be particuarly aerodynamic.  This Charm removes any accuracy
  penalties which the character would otherwise suffer due to these weapons
  being improvised.
  
  By spending a further 2 motes, the Discordian can also improvise any mundane
  sort of bow if vaguely suitable materials are available.  The bow will cease
  to function as such after the scene ends.

  TODO
  
  This Charm supplements an Archery attack, either adding Erisian elemental
  effects to the character's existing ammunition, or conjuring a sliver of
  Essence to act as ammunition itself, aspected towards a element of the
  character's choice.  Any mundane kind of ammunition can be formed, with an
  appearance clearly showing the type of Essence, and is treated as fine
  equipment.  If he is a member of <<Parameta_Seed_from_Tree>> and has changed
  his anima to a Dragon-Blooded element, he may also choose to use one or more
  of the normal elements of Creation--for the effects of which see the
  description of the Dragon-Blooded Charm Dragon-Graced Arrow.

  The effects of the Erisian elements are as follow.  *Orange* allows the
  character to reflexively spend 1 mote at Step 7 of any successful attack to
  convert 4 levels of bashing damage, or 2 levels of lethal damage, into 1
  level of aggravated damage.  No more than 1 level of aggravated damage can
  be gained in this way.  *Sweet* allows the character to reduce the final
  number of levels of damage suffered by the target by up to (Essence), with
  the character regaining half that many motes, or a single point of
  Willpower.  This is limited by the number of Health Levels the target has
  remaining: if an attack would cause 10 levels of lethal damage, and the
  target has only 2 levels remaining, then the character can gain at most a
  single mote, doing no damage to the target.  Also, this effect is applied
  after all other effects which might reduce the damage the target would
  suffer.  *Boom* produces a thunderous noise on a successful attack, and
  forces the target to check for Knockdown with a difficulty of 4--or, if the
  attack would already have forced a check for Knockdown, it adds the
  character's (Essence) to the difficulty.  *Pungent* relases a puff of
  unpleasant and overwhelming scent on impact, which requires the target to
  make a reflexive (Stamina + Resistance) roll or suffer a -2 penalty on all
  actions for the next (Essence) actions, as a Poison effect.  *Prickle*
  inflicts a distracting itching sensation, whose location seems to
  continually move, adding 1 to the Speed of the target's next (Essence)
  actions, as a Crippling effect.  *Dirt* gets into the target's eyes, adding
  a -2 external penalty to all actions requiring sight, for the next (Essence)
  actions, as a Crippling effect.  *Focus* makes the target temporarily
  unwilling to divert from her current course, requiring her to fail a
  Conviction roll or suppress that Virtue each time she wants to attack a
  different target, or to stop attacking, until the end of the scene.  *Dream*
  sends the target into partial reverie for the next (Essence) actions,
  applying a -2 external penalty to MDVs.  *Binding* removes 2 points of
  external penalty from attempts to disarm a target.  For the normal elements
  of Creation, apply the benefits of the Dragon-Blooded Charm Dragon-Graced
  Arrow.

  The character must wield a bow, firewand or other appropriate weapon to use
  this Charm.  He can stack multiple activations of this Charm in a single
  attack, to combine several effects into one, in which case the cost is half
  the number of elements involved.

  This Charm supplements an Archery action by allowing the character to use
  himself as ammunition.  This allows him to Jump towards his target, up to
  one fifth the range which the attack would otherwise have.  If the action is
  an attack, the character may make an unarmed attack, or one which uses
  weapons which can be wielded at the same time as his current Archery weapon
  (e.g., a smashfist worn while using a bow).  This attack gains the Knockback
  keyword, and is treated as part of the same attack, using the Archery attack
  roll to hit, but the other weapon's details to determine damage in Step 7.
  This Charm may be used in a flurry, but attacks beyond the first in the
  flurry do not gain the Knockback keyword from this Charm.
  
  By spending a point of Willpower the Soft and Steady Hand can Jump up to the
  full range of his weapon.  If the attack's range has been extended by other
  magics, the Storyteller may rule that the Jump lasts more than one action.
  
  When using this Charm, the character may make a (Dexterity + Archery) roll
  to catch his weapon as he jumps, and take it with him if successful.
  Failure means that the weapon remains at the origin of the jump.  Note also
  that this Charm need not necessarily be used as an attack: it could be used
  to allow the character to jump up to a high balcony, for example.

  As recounted in stories of old, a well-timed magical arrow can influence the
  course of people's lives.  Erisians bring these legends to life with
  Piercing the Heart: the Exalt mimes shooting an arrow, firewand or
  similar--a weapon is required, but no ammunition is actually used--and sends
  an invisible bolt of Essence, carrying emotional influence towards a single
  target.  The attack causes no damage, is unblockable with mundane weapons or
  armor, applies a -2 external penalty to the target's DV due to its
  invisibilty, and is unaffected by Hardness or soak.  Steps 7 and 8 of attack
  resolution will be irrelevant, unless some unusual Reflexive Charm applies.
  
  If the attack achieves even one success, this Charm inspires any one desired
  emotion intensely for one scene.  Resisting the influence costs two
  Willpower, and will make the target aware of the attempt at unnatural
  influence.
  
  By spending an additional 3 motes and 1 Willpower, the Exalt can cause the
  emotion to fade gradually over the course of (character's Essence) days.
  After the first scene, the effect can be resisted for only 1 Willpower.
  However, even once they have resisted it, the target will tend to regard the
  temporary emotional aberrance as having been genuinely their own,
  fabricating some convincing explanation for themselves, until the Charm's
  duration ends.  If they are to recognise and remember the unnatural effect
  once the Charm has ended, they must spend a further 2 Willpower, after which
  they become permanently aware of what happened.  Witnesses may spend 1
  Willpower to realise the source of the emotion provided they saw the Exalt's
  attack, but they may do this at any time at or after that initial attack.
  
  Using this attack does not end any Stealth effects on the character, unless
  the target successfully resists the influence using Willpower at the moment
  of the initial attack.

  This Charm allows the Moonlight Lyre to bend and loop the flow of time,
  loosing an arrow to meet an incoming attack at precisely the right instant
  to knock it off track.  This perfectly parries any attack, even if it is
  unblockable.  By spending 1 point of Willpower, the character can even apply
  this Charm without ammunition, by miming the shot.  In this case, the Charm
  gains the Obvious keyword, as a strange ripple of distorted moments passes
  through the air on the way to deflect the attack.
  
  With a second purchase at Essence 4+, the character can use this Charm in a
  Defend Other action to defend any other being who would be a valid target
  for an Archery attack by her, by shooting down an attack as it heads toward
  that target.

  This Charm is subject to one of the Discordian Flaws of Invulnerability.

  This Charm supplements an Archery-based attack by the character, rapidly
  opening and closing a semi-stable portal to Elsewhere at the point of
  impact, causing a violent upsetting of the target's balance.  The target
  must roll his (Stamina + Resistance) against the character's (Strength +
  Archery).  The attack must hit (i.e., not be dodged or parried), but need
  not inflict damage.  If the target fails this check, he is knocked prone (as
  a Knockdown effect, rather than Knockback).
  
  By spending an extra two motes and a point of Willpower, the character can
  force all beings within (Essence x 3) yards of the point of impact to check
  for Knockback, each rolling (Stamina + Resistance) againt the character's
  (Strength + Archery).  Inanimate objects up to roughly human mass will, if
  they are not fastened down, also be knocked back.  If the target dodged or
  parried the attack without using a perfect defence, they must make a second
  check to avoid being knocked back from wherever the projectile landed.  If
  the Erisian herself is within this radius, she will not be knocked back, and
  her affinity with dynamic chaos means she will ``luckily'' avoid being hit
  by any flying objects.
  
  The character may make this attack without any ammunition, simply by miming
  an attack using a suitable weapon.  In this case, the target will not suffer
  damage from the attack itself, but is at a -4 penalty to his DV, since the
  only indication of the impact will be a shimmering in the air at the last
  moment.

  This Charm creates a stable, if short-lived, pair of portals to Elsewhere.
  The first portal is created at the point of impact of the shot to which this
  Charm is applied, and the second wherever the character's next shot (with
  the same weapon) lands.  Subsequent shots alternately relocate the first and
  second portals.  The character cannot choose for a shot not to move a
  portal, unless it lands out of range, or the character uses a different
  weapon.  Solid and liquid surfaces produce valid impacts, but gas
  interfaces, magical barriers and so do not, unless further magics somehow
  effectively render them solid.
  
  When only the first portal is open, objects or beings which enter it are
  suspended in Elsewhere.  It appears as a translucent grey disc with fringed
  edges, (Essence x 2) feet wide and with almost no depth, aligned as evenly
  as possible with the surface struck.  It can be seen from both sides, if the
  object struck transmits light, but can only be entered from the side from
  which the projectile struck.  Those walking into it from the other side will
  pass through it as though it were entirely insubstantial.  Those looking
  through this translucent surface suffer a -2 external penalty to vision,
  including the accuracy of attacks passing through it.  The space beyond this
  single portal is featureless grey, has no particular shape, and a volume
  roughly equal to a sphere with a diameter matching the portal.  If the space
  is filled before the second portal appears, nothing else can enter.
  
  When the second portal appears, anything which entered the first portal
  immediately exits through it.  Once both are open, anything passing into
  either portal immediately reappears from the other.  In any case, objects
  and beings emerge from one portal with the same speed they had when they
  entered the other, but with their direction of movement adjusted as if the
  two portals were back to back.  Anyone looking into either portal from its
  active side will see the view from the other portal.  Anyone looking at
  either portal from the other side, however, will see straight through it.
  In both cases, vision is still subject to the -2 penalty due to the grey
  haze of a thin layer of Elsewhere.  Any number of beings or object may pass
  freely through the portals at a time, provided they fit through, as if they
  formed a mundane doorway.
  
  As long as there is only a single portal, any being or automaton may find a
  way back out on a successful Willpower roll, against a difficulty of the
  Discordian's Essence, in which case they similarly emerge at their original
  speed, but moving in the opposite direction.
  
  The portals cannot be moved except by the character taking further shots.
  They can be at most (Essence x 100) yards apart, and shots which land
  further from the relevant portal will not cause its twin to move.  It is
  explicitly permitted for the character to fire a shot through a portal,
  which will cause that portal to relocate when it hits, provided the distance
  limit is not exceeded.  It is not impossible to have each portal in a
  different realm of existence, if the character manages to fire through some
  other other pre-existing gateway.  In that case, the distance is calculated
  as the sum of two straight lines, from each portal to the pre-existing
  gateway.
