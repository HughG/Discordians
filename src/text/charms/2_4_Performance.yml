  The Wondering Minstrels do whatever they can to engage the hearts and minds
  of their audience, even if appropriate props are not available.
  
  This Charm affects all Performance actions for the rest of the scene,
  allowing the character to improvise instruments, scenery, costumes, dramatic
  lighting etc., provided some at least vaguely suitable materials are to
  hand.  Hence external penalties due to lack of props etc. are removed.  This
  Charm does not allow the character to properly play unfamiliar instruments,
  but it will allow them to use the instrument in an incorrect but
  entertaining manner, e.g., treating a shamisen as a drum.  This Charm also
  reduces the difficulty of all Performance actions, including prayer, by 1.

  Experts in the misunderstandings of meaning and meaninglessness, the
  children of Eris can choose their words and actions to convey more than one
  story at once, carefully tuned to different audiences.
  
  This Charm provides the character with a magical flurry of up to (Essence)
  social attacks, each of which she must direct against a different target,
  though the target may be a group or an individual, as appropriate to that
  attack.  The MDV penalty for the flurry is equal to the highest penalty for
  any one attack.

  In a matter of minutes, the Midnight Lyres can persuade folk that they are
  epic heroes, infamous villains or otherwise dramatic characters.  Activating
  this Charm, the character spends a few minutes talking to a group (of
  Magnitude up to the character's Essence), attempting to convince them that
  he is some famous individual, either one already known to them or some
  completely invented figure.  This Charm supplements the relevant social
  attack roll, adding one automatic success and making it a form of unnatural
  mental influence.  As usual, targets may spend 1 point of Willpower to
  resist.
  
  If the character is still present when the Charm's duration ends,
  twenty-five hours later, affected targets will likely be most upset.
  However, they will also become subject to the effects of the character's
  recumbent destiny, unless it is supressed.  If the character leaves before
  then, he will remain in their memory as this figure of legend.  The
  character may use the Charm repeatedly to sustain the Illusion, though
  targets gain a fresh opportunity to resist.

  TODO
  
  Opening mouth and mind, the character activates this Charm in the presence
  of any being, and finds himself recounting excerpts from the history of that
  individual's deeds.  The information comes not from the Exalt's own mind but
  from the power of stories themselves (in game terms, from the Storyteller),
  and so the information revealed will be generally known, though not
  necessarily in the surrounding location.  In a matter of a few minutes, the
  character will have spoken of some of the major encounters and actions of
  the target's life, including some trivial but entertaining details, and some
  which hint at the target's Motivation and/or Intimacies.  All information
  will be true, and the character is guaranteed to learn at least one new
  thing, though he may or may not recognise that.
  
  If the target has successfully disguised themselves from the character, the
  stories will adapt to avoid revealing their true identity.  For example, a
  Sidereal who is a Bronze Faction enforcer, but is currently wearing a
  resplendent destiny, might be told of as having driven out heretics and
  evil-doers, without specifying which ones.
  
  To the target, the effect of this Charm is difficult to distinguish from a
  great skill in cold reading plus a smattering of unexpected inside
  information.  Nevertheless, in social combat it is unnerving.  The character
  rolls (Perception + Performance + Essence) and compares it to the target's
  Dodge MDV.  If the roll is greater, the target suffers an internal penalty
  of (-Performance) on the next action, due to a brief feeling of emotional
  exposure.
  
  The target must be able to hear the character's words (or otherwise perceive
  them clearly and immediately).  A city, building, demesne or other location
  may also be a valid target for this Charm, as long as the character can find
  a resident to whom his performance can be directed.
  
  This Charm may be used on a given target at most once per story, unless the
  target has since done more significant deeds, or the character learns facts
  elsewhere which specifically hint at other dramatic parts of the target's
  past.

  TODO
  
  This Charm supplements a Performance roll targeted at a single individual,
  singing the praises of some individual, to win or weaken the affections and
  loyalty of the target.  The subject of the song, poem, oratary etc. may be
  the Exalt herself, or any other being living or dead, real or imagined.  The
  target forms a positive or negative Intimacy towards that individual, which
  may be one of love, lust, loyalty or some other emotion chosen by the
  character.  If the target already has an Intimacy to the subject, both are
  retained, which may result in internal conflict and confusing behaviour.
  
  The target can spend a point of temporary Willpower to resist for one scene,
  and the Charm's effects end once the target has spent three points in total.

  TODO
  
  This Charm supplements a Performance roll targeted at a social group, which
  encourages them towards an almost or actually religious faith in some new
  idea.  The object of this faith cannot be the character herself.  The idea
  need not actually be heretical but it must be one which the people have not
  so far, as a group, considered as a serious belief, and which unbalances the
  current order.
  
  The Moonlight Lyre must spend a scene addressing the group.  At the end of
  this time, if her persuasion was successful, the character will have created
  a new cult, which contributes to a Training effect which raises her Cult
  Background.  To raise the Cult rating to a given level, the character must
  found that many brand new cults, each with a separate use of the Charm.  For
  example, to go from Cult 2 to Cult 3 requires three successful applications
  of this Charm.  The character may start as many new cults as the Storyteller
  will allow, though her Cult Background cannot be increased beyond normal
  limits.  Also, a cult only counts towards the Training effect of this Charm
  if it has a different object from any other that the character has
  previously founded using this Charm.  Cults founded by this Charm may grow
  later, of course.
  
  If the object of a new cult is a being, that being also gains a rating of
  Cult 1, if it does not already have a Cult rating.  The character may choose
  some individual other than herself as the target of the Training effect, in
  which case that individual cannot be the object of the new cult(s).  If the
  target does not explicitly consent to this indirect worship, the Discordian
  must pay the experience point cost for this Training.
  
  The Charm does not in itself involve unnatural mental influence, though it
  may be supplemented with such.

  The Matchmakers are so tied to the notion of ``union with the other'' that
  they may seek to impress and take nourishment from even their enemies.
  Striking a tragic pose of weakened defense in battle, bustling around during
  delicate surgery, or otherwise trying to look like he is being epically
  helpful, the Hand takes some of the glory.
  
  While this Charm is active, the character may benefit from stunts by any
  other character; those which occur within (Essence x 5) yards, plus any
  associated with an action of which he is the target (regardless of range).
  The individual performing the stunt gains the full rewards but, in addition,
  the character gains half that, rounded up in the case of Willpower.  Taking
  the reflected glory of a reward in this way costs 1 mote, which must be paid
  after the character knows that a stunt has been awarded to the target, but
  before the relevant roll is made.  The character must be aware of the
  action: unexpected or concealed actions cannot be affected by this Charm.
  The entity taking the action still gains the relevant bonus dice, and if the
  stunt is good enough to result in a reward of experience in place of
  Willpower, the character does not gain experience.
  
  This siphoning of benefits is a Shaping effect, although it does not
  directly target the victim, instead applying to the overall stage of
  endeavors.  Thus personal resistance to Shaping cannot counter this Charm,
  but area effects can.  The mathematically apt will note that activating this
  effect for a 1-die stunt is pointless.

  We know not the moment of our deaths (unless we're unlucky enough to feature
  in accurate prophecy); therefore, some Discordians choose to practise, just
  to be prepared.  An Exalt who employs this Charm appears to die in a
  dramatic fashion, reducing all damage from a single source to zero after all
  other modifiers in Step 10 and becoming Inactive.  This Charm functions as a
  perfect defence, with the special Flaw of Invulnerability that the character
  must remain Inactive for at least one full action after activating it.
  Damage from one-off environmental effects can be avoided with this Charm,
  but not ongoing effects such as general scorching heat.
  
  He will seem dead to any casual mundane or magical inspection: his pulse
  will seem to stop, his Essence flicker out.  Observers who have reason to
  disbelieve this, or are especially motivated to be quite certain that the
  Erisian character is dead (``bring me his head!''), will find themselves
  subject to an Illusion effect to accept the death and move on.  If any
  observer successfully resists the mental influence of the Illusion, the
  Exalt will know of it.  The Illusion costs 2 points of Willpower to resist.
  
  The effect lasts as long as he remains Inactive, though he may choose to
  reflexively end this at any time after the first action.  Once he becomes
  active, for whatever reason, the Illusion will not be effective on the same
  observers for the rest of the scene.  Indeed, for the rest of the story,
  observers gain a bonus equal to (5 - Exalt's Essence), minimum 1, to their
  rolls to see through the Illusion of this Charm.

  Music may soothe the savage beast, or it may make things even worse.
  Playing an instrument of her choice, or simply singing, the Matchmaker
  employs this Charm to exert an unnatural mental influence on a group of
  Magnitude up to the Exalt's Essence.  Those affected have either their
  Willpower, or one of their Virtues (at the character's choice) reduced by
  the character's Essence, to a minimum of 0, for as long as she continues to
  perform.  Alternatively, the character can provide all affected targets with
  (Essence) bonus dice to all rolls for one chosen Virtue, or Willpower, for
  the duration.  For natural fauna, be they of Creation, the Underworld,
  Malfeas or elsewhere, the character may elect to reduce their Control Rating
  instead.  In mass combat, this Charm may be used to alter Drill, Morale or
  the effective number of Relays.  Although this Charm is Stackable, stacked
  uses cannot benefit the same Trait.
  
  At any time each member of the group may pay one point of temporary
  Willpower to resist the influence for one scene.  If the character continues
  to play beyond the end of one scene, however, they must spend again or come
  under the Charm's effects.  After spending a total of three points of
  Willpower against the effects of this Charm, a given individual will be free
  of its effects for the remainder of the story.  The target group must be
  able to hear or see the character for this Charm to work.
