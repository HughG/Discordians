  This Charm summons the Erisian's Melee weapon to his hand, from any point up
  to (Essence x 2) yards away.  The weapon must be one which the character
  owns.  It travels via Elsewhere, meaning that most bindings, even magical
  ones, will not prevent it from returning to his hand.  The character may use
  this Charm to reflexively ready a weapon and attack in the same action.
  
  A second purchase at Melee 3 and Essence 3 allows the character to use the
  Charm with an Indefinite duration, suspending a weapon in Elsewhere.  It
  will remain there as long as the motes remain committed.  When they are
  reflexively released, it will appear in his hand, or falls to his feet if
  both hands are occupied.

  A successful warrior grows to understand of the ebb and flow, balance and
  unbalance of combat.  Reading the moments of mischance in her opponent's
  strikes allows the Offendi respond instinctively with her own, and take
  advantage of both strength and weakness.
  
  Using her opponent's own impetus and skill against him, the character uses
  this Charm to counterattack at her full dice pool.  Each carry-over success
  from the original attack, regardless of whether it did any damage, adds one
  die to the character's counterattack, to a maximum of her own Essence.

  An Apple Corpsman may choose to attack directly, but is just as likely to
  approach in unexpected ways, to cause maximum confusion.  His powers allow
  him to draw the mystery of Elsewhere over the edge or point of his weapon,
  causing it to appear instead a short distance away, at a spot which will do
  the most damage to his target.
  
  This Charm supplements a Melee attack in a number of ways.  It applies a -1
  external penalty to the defender's DVs, unless he or she can somehow see
  into Elsewhere.  It causes the attack to ignore any Hardness or soak due to
  armour or any similar protections beyond the target's own skin, and to
  ignore DV bonuses due to cover.  It does not cause the attack to ignore
  natural soak, or soak added by Charms.  It furthermore effectively allows
  attacks to pass through solid objects, though some magical wards may prevent
  this.  If the character cannot otherwise percieve the target through any
  such objects, the attack will suffer an external penalty as severe as
  blindness (-4), unless some other effect improves the situation.  The target
  must still be in melee range, though the weapon gains the Reach tag if it
  did not have it already.

  This Charm extends the power of its prerequisite, causing the Corpswoman's
  entire weapon to slide briefly sideways via Elsewhere and strike her
  intended target from an unpredictable angle: from behind, below, above, or
  perhaps just from the other hand.  The attack becomes unexpected unless the
  target succeeds on a (Wits + Awareness) roll at a difficulty of the
  character's Essence.  With appropriate stunts, the character may attempt to
  make the attack appear to originate from another nearby being.  The target
  must still be in melee range, though the weapon gains the Reach tag if it
  did not have it already.

  Treading that fine line between control and abandon, the Corpsman sends the
  sharp edges and points of his weapon into Elsewhere, freeing them to follow
  his opponent's movements rather than his own will.  The weapon skips past
  mundane and magical attempts to block it, and sticks to the target through
  feints and ducks.
  
  This Charm supplements a Melee attack to make it unblockable and
  undodgeable, such that both Parry and Dodge Defense Values inapplicable.
  The target must still be in melee range, though the weapon gains the Reach
  tag if it did not have it already.
  
  By spending an additional 2 motes, the attack can reach out over larger
  distances and, unless some magical warding prevents this, through solid
  objects.  The range of the attack extends to twice the character's Dash
  distance, and it ignores DV bonuses due to cover.  Armor and soak still
  apply, and attack penalties may apply if the character attempts to attack
  through a barrier but cannot see the target through it.

  TODO
  
  Activating this Charm, the Apple Corpsman reflexively grabs a nearby object
  and employs it as an improvised melee weapon, with normal ratings for
  whatever kind of weapon can be described as most appropriate, and without
  any penalties due to it being an improvised weapon.  Clubs, staves and
  sledges are the most likely equivalents.  For the last, the character can
  use any sufficiently large item which he can lift with a feat of Strength.
  In general, any kind of weapon can be improvised, if suitable scenery can be
  found.
  
  An unattuned artifact weapon can be used but this raises the Charm's cost to
  5 motes, and requires a feat of Strength with a difficulty equal to twice
  the Strength minimum required to wield it if it were attuned.  The character
  gains no magical material bonuses for this but, if he wields the weapon
  continuously for the scene, he may choose to immediately attune it at the
  end of the scene, paying the appropriate cost.
  
  If the character is disarmed, he can reflexively pay 1 mote to re-activate
  this Charm for another weapon, which is immediately readied, provided one is
  within reach.

  Concentrating for just a fraction of a second, the Overseer imposes her own
  understanding of reality on the space between her hands, conjuring a melee
  weapon of his choice out of Essence aspected towards an Erisian element of
  the character's choice.  If she is a member of the 3rd Division and has
  changed her anima to a Dragon-Blooded element, she may instead choose to use
  the element of that anima.  The weapon is treated as an exceptional example
  of its kind, and provides further benefits depending on the element, as
  described in the Archery Charm <<Archery_pps>>.  For the normal elements of
  Creation, apply the benefits of the Dragon-Blooded Charm Dragon-Graced
  Weapon.  The weapon can be given to others, but cannot be used for any
  purpose other than Melee attacks, and will vanish if used to attack the
  character.  The weapon vanishes in a burst of elementally-aspected Essence
  when the character releases the commitment of motes, or at the end of the
  scene.

  If the character attempts to parry a non-ranged attack and succeeds
  (including the use of perfect defenses), she may activate this Charm to
  cause the attack to be re-rolled against any other valid target.  If she
  fails to parry it, and it is not unblockable, she may pay 5 motes to
  activate this Charm.  If the Charm is activated and there are no other valid
  targets, the attack fails altogether.
  
  The attacker may ignore the unnatural mental influence of this Charm by
  spending a point of temporary Willpower.  This Charm is normally ineffective
  against ranged attacks because, by the time such an attack can be parried,
  the attacker can no longer be influenced to redirect it.  However, if the
  attack is subject to some effect which allows it to be controlled after it
  is launched, the character will instinctively know this, and can apply this
  Charm.

  TODO
  
  Activating this Charm, the character subjects himself to the effects of
  Knockback (or doubles the distance, if it would already apply), leaving
  himself prone, but gains the opportunity to make a Disarming attempt as a
  Counterattack.  The attempt is made without the usual -2 penalty for close
  combat and, if he succeeds and has hands free, he automatically takes hold
  of the weapon.  If he succeeds but cannot grasp the weapon, it lands within
  his reach.
  
  This Charm can only be activated when the character is hit by or
  successfully parries a close range attack.  It is inapplicable if the
  character dodges an attack, and is generally inapplicable against ranged
  attacks, though a suitable stunt may allow it, if the projectile is one the
  character could reasonably grasp and re-use.  Also, the Disarm action
  reduces the character's DV by -1 and he cannot use it in combination with
  any other counterattack.  If the attacker was making a flurry of attacks
  against the character, this Charm forces the flurry to end, unless the
  attacker can move to keep up with him.

  By surrendering his will to whims beyond Fate, the Tower-Builder renders
  himself unassailable with a careless sweep of his weapon.  His apparently
  wild and artless swing nonetheless happens to end up at the exactly the
  right spot to deflect an impending blow.
  
  *[TODO: RWG said that Dodge_pe was flavorless because it was a straight
  perfect, and the first purchase of this Charm is, too.  Should I change
  it?]*

  This Charm allows the Discordian to perfectly defend against any attack,
  even if it is unblockable.  A second purchase at Essence 4+ allows the
  character to pay an additional point of Willpower to send the bulk of his
  weapon through a twist in Elsewhere and apply a perfect Defend Other action
  on any being within Dash range, who would be a valid target for a Melee
  attack by him.  The character does not actually have to dash to the being he
  wishes to defend, in this case.  This Charm suffers from one of the
  Discordian Flaws of Invulnerability.

  The Children of Eris rail against strictures and structures which offend
  them, including the rules of space which prevent all things existing at one
  point.  Casting a net of Elsewhere strands across her blade, she causes
  slices of it to appear in several places at once as she strikes.

  *[TODO: This is almost(?) exactly the same as the Archery one, so I should
  just reference it, not reproduce the entire text.]*
  
  This Charm provides the Exalt with a magical flurry of two or more
  Melee-based attacks.  Each attack costs 3 motes, including the first, and
  the character may make a number of attacks up to (her permanent Essence),
  regardless of the weapon's Rate.  The Charm allows her to make these attacks
  without multiple action penalties and with a DV penalty equal to the highest
  penalty for any one attack.  The Speed of the combined actions is one more
  than the Speed of the longest single action.  For weapons with a Rate less
  than 1, the character must spend one (or more) of her extra actions
  realigning the momentum of the weapon after each attack.
  
  At Essence 3, the character may additionally spend 1 point of Willpower to
  add an unpredictable shift to her own physical presence, allowing her to
  ignore all DV penalties from these attacks (but not from other sources).

  The Erisian makes a cutting sweep with his weapon, in the direction of his
  target but without coming anywhere close to hitting.  Indeed, the target may
  be anywhere within (Essence x 10) yards, provided the character can perceive
  it.  The attack causes no damage, is unblockable with mundane weapons or
  armor, applies a -2 external penalty to the target's DV due to its
  invisibilty (unless the target has Essence sight or similar), and is
  unaffected by Hardness or soak.
  
  If the attack achieves even one success, this Charm applies an Illusion
  which cuts one thing out of the target's awareness.  Resisting the influence
  costs two Willpower, and will make the target aware of the attempt at
  unnatural influence.
  
  Any one object or being may be removed from the target's awareness, provided
  it is also in range of the Charm and is no larger than (Essence) times the
  character's own volume.  The target will not be consciously aware of the
  excised item, and will unconsciously avoid interacting with it if possible.
  If interaction is forced, e.g., because the hidden being attacks, or the
  target falls through a hidden trap-door when it is opened, then the Illusion
  ends.  A hidden being may move at normal speed and make a small amount of
  noise, such as the gentle creak and clank of armour, without disturbing the
  target.  However, running around in metal armour, causing loud noises or
  bright flashes, or using Obvious Charms or similar activities will end the
  Illusion.  This Charm's concealment may be used to set up an unexpected
  attack, but that attack will also break the Illusion.
  
  Alternatively, the character may make the target lose touch with one of its
  Intimacies, believing that the formerly important person or value is of no
  particular importance.  If the character knows one or more of the target's
  Intimacies, he may choose a particular one to detach.  If not, or if he
  wishes to leave things to chance, the Storyteller selects one.  The scene
  then counts as a scene spent weakening the Intimacy.  Provided it still has
  at least one dot after being reduced, the Intimacy reasserts itself when the
  scene ends.
  
  Using this attack does not end any Stealth effects on the character, unless
  the target successfully resists the influence using Willpower at the moment
  of the initial attack.
  
  Witnesses may spend 1 Willpower to realise the source of the target's
  strange behaviour provided they saw the Exalt's attack, but they may do this
  at any time at or after that initial attack.
