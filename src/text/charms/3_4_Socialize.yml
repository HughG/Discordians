  TODO
  
  This Charm supplements a social attack, removing any DV bonuses which the
  target being or social group would gain from the attack being in opposition
  to its Intimacies, Virtues or Motivation.  Furthermore, if the attack
  succeeds and was aimed at persuading the target towards a particular belief,
  value or goal, then the attack counts as a scene spent by the target in
  building an Intimacy towards that.  Equally, if a successful attack was
  aimed at persuading the target away from an existing Intimacy, then it
  counts as a scene spend eroding it.  Characters and social groups may hold
  conflicting Intimacies, so building a new one which conflicts with an
  existing Intimacy or Motivation does not necessarily damage the latter,
  though bonuses and penalties from these conflicting values may cancel out.
  
  The character can target himself with this Charm, including using it in Step
  2 as a form of defence.  *[TODO Not clear what I meant there.  Did I mean
  the character could attack himself, in response to an attack, to give
  himself a defensive Intimacy?  If so, that doesn't really work, in terms of
  attack resolution timing.  Maybe it could allow the character to remove any
  MDV penalties he would have due to his own Intimacies etc.?]* Note that,
  being Reflexive, this Charm can enhance rolls and be used in Combos with
  Charms from other Abilities.

  TODO
  
  This Charm enhances its prerequisite, making the mental influence unnatural
  and enabling the character to build a fully-fledged Intimacy in the target
  instantly, if her attack succeeds, but only if it conflicts in some way with
  one the target already holds.  The new Intimacy is treated as equally valid
  for all purposes.  From then on, if some effect depends on the Intimacies
  the target holds, he may regard either or both as taking effect or
  precedence, as he prefers.  Both will remain indefinitely, but a scene spent
  reinforcing one subsequently (or any other effect which reinforces it) also
  counts as weakening the other, and vice versa, unless this Charm is
  re-invoked.  This Charm does not enhance the character's ability to wear
  away existing Intimacies.
  
  If the target holds more than his maximum number of Intimacies, then an
  Intimacy of his choice will start to fade out after the scene in which this
  Charm is invoked.  This can be any Intimacy, including the one added by this
  Charm.
  
  If the character does not know any of the target's Intimacies, or none of
  his known Intimacies suit her purposes, she may attempt to build an Intimacy
  opposing some other belief, value or goal.  If the target in fact has an
  Intimacy which matches closely enough, as determined by the Storyteller,
  then the Charm succeeds, otherwise it has no effect and the motes are
  wasted.

  This Charm adds (Socialize) to the difficulty of all attempts to read the
  character's Motivation, Intimacies, Virtue ratings, emotions or intentions
  in the current scene.  If the attempt at reading her would have succeeded

  aligns with her Motivation, Virtues or Intimacies, and the attacker does not

  This Charm allows the character to apply the protection of [dmi] on a

  It is as much by trickery as by force of personality that the Tower-Builders
  drag others into their schemes.  A favorite approach is to twist words to
  persuade others that their own rebuttals do not, in fact, counter the
  Discordian's true point.
  
  This Charm renders the target's Parry Mental Defense Value inapplicable
  against the character's attack, making it unblockable.  By spending an
  additional 2 motes the character can employ this Charm to gain a
  Counterattack against any Social attack, which is again unblockable.

  The Offendis know that to get a group to cooperate, one must consider all
  members' points of view, and with the self-contradictory wisdom of Eris they
  are uniquely skilled at doing so.
  
  This Charm allows the character to briefly shift her opinion in the face of
  a social attack, her response treating it in a totally different way to what
  the attacker intended -- possibly part way through a sentence which seems to
  whole-heartedly accept the point made.  The effect is to perfectly parry any
  social attack, even if it is unblockable.
  
  Additionally, at Socialize 4+, the skill with which the character renders
  her surprising response imposes an external penalty of -(Essence) on any
  further social attacks based around the same point or similar ones, from any
  character present at the time, in the following action.  This penalty
  decreases by 1 over subsequent actions until it reaches zero.

  TODO
  
  This Charm supplements a (Manipulation + Socialize) roll to establish
  surprise for a Social attack, causing it to succeed automatically unless the
  target employs supernatural senses or magic to support the opposing
  (Perception + Intelligence) roll.  In that case, the Charm still adds
  (Socialize รท 2) successes to the character's roll.
  
  Additionally, the character may use Charisma in place of Manipulation to
  establish or re-establish surprise, to indicate his skill in bending the
  topic without actually changing it.  However, each such attempt after the
  first is at a cumulative -1 internal penalty for the same topic of
  conversation in a scene.  The penalty is reset to zero at the start of a new
  scene, or by changing topic, either by dramatic statement or by rolling
  (Manipulation + Socialize) to reestablish surprise.  If the character
  returns to the same topic in the same scene, the penalty picks up where it
  left off.

  TODO
  
  This Charm gives the character insight into the social norms, pressures and
  desires of a group with which she is interacting.  As long as the Charm
  remains active, she reduces external penalties on actions related to
  understanding and taking advantage of knowledge of the Intimacies,
  Motivation, customs and taboos of a specific group.  The reduction is equal
  to the lower of (her Socialize) and (the Magnitude of those present who
  belong to the group).  As well as Socialize rolls (for example, to identify
  individuals who oppose the norms), this bonus can apply to other abilities.
  For example, it could apply to Larceny rolls to pass herself off as a member
  of the group, Medicine rolls to realize that a certain treatment is
  considered heretical, Bureacracy rolls to guess the local favored form of
  bribes, and so on.  Arbitration of the scope is up to the Storyteller.
  
  By default, the group to which Charm's effect relates will be the group
  which the majority of beings visible (or otherwise clearly perceptible) to
  the Exalt consider themselves to belong to.  This will most often be a local
  social grouping such as ``citizens of this town or kingdom''.  If the
  character is aware of more general or more specific groups to which most of
  those present belong, she may select one of those groups, for example,
  ``Autochthonian mortals'', ``The Guild'', ``worshippers of a specific god''.
  
  She may also opt to fish for groupings which are secret or simply unknown to
  her.  This requires a successful ([Perception or Intelligence] + Socialize)
  roll.  The difficulty is 1 but the roll is subject to an external penalty,
  determined by the Storyteller on the basis of how much effort those present
  are putting into concealing their allegiances--typically ([Manipulation +
  Socialize + Magnitude] รท 2).  If the roll fails, or no such groupings exist,
  the Charm's effect is spent.  If successful, the character will know that
  such a grouping exists, but will not automatically know anything about it,
  nor which persons present are members.  Further rolls are required, possibly
  with bonus dice from this Charm, to learn more about it.
  
  At Essence 3+ the character can apply this Charm to a group which she can
  perceive, without having to interact with them or even reveal her presence,
  though she must observe them for a scene first to do so.  At Essence 4+ the
  Magnitude of those present no longer limits the reduction of external
  penalties: she can obtain her full (Socialize) rating in reduction on the
  basis of interacting with or observing even a single individual.

  TODO
  
  *[TODO: Hmm, maybe this should be Sorcery? cf. Hideous Confusion of
  Tongues.]*

  *[Not sure about the mechanics here, on several fronts.  (1) It currently
  only works for Keyworded effects, but it could be just as useful, and ought
  to be easier, to make non-magical emotions or beliefs contagious.  (2) It
  says "successfully-applied", but by whom, and in what time-span?  Would make
  more sense if it picked up on any one emotion, belief, or keyworded effect
  currently applying to the target.  In that case, the original attack may not
  be known (or there may have been no attack); so, either make it an attack
  with the target's/character's dice pool against the new victim's Dodge MDV,
  or make it an infection-style "roll to resist", with a difficulty equal to
  ... the character's Essence?  (3) HCoT costs 35m and each victim is affected
  and infectious for (Essence x 2) hours; maybe something similar would be
  good -- Indefinite effect but the spell ends automatically if all affected
  targets reach the end of their period of affliction.  That spell also allows
  victims to be re-infected unless counter-magicked, but this Charm, being
  non-sorcerous, might not.  On the other hand, when the infection lifts for
  *this* Charm, we might rule that people still feel or believe the thing the
  Charm carried to them, but are now able to be persuaded away from it with a
  single success on a mundane social "attack" to calm them down -- whereas
  their state of mind/heart would be magically protected while they were
  infected by this Charm, requiring a magically-enhanced attack to break them
  free and/or increasing the difficulty to "cure" them.]*
  
  This Charm enables the power of any successfully-applied Compulsion,
  Emotion, Illusion or Servitude effect to extend gradually to a larger target
  group, in a contagious manner.  The effect to be extended may come from a
  Charm used in a Combo with this Charm but need not do so, nor even from the
  character at all: it can be applied to an existing, ongoing effect from any
  source.
  
  Every being who interacts with the group, including the character himself,
  is subject to the same attack or other effect as originally applied.  If
  that being defends against the attack, spends Willpower to resist it, or
  otherwise avoids it, they remain immune to the contagion for its full
  duration.  If not, the original effect applies in full, and they also become
  contagious.
  
  The contagion will spread as long as unaffected beings interact with those
  affected, until the Magnitude of the total number affected is up to
  (Socialize) dots greater than the group affected by the original effect.
  Each such additional dot costs three motes.  If the duration of the original
  effect is less than that of this Charm, the contagion may continue to
  spread, but will not re-affect those for whom the duration has passed,
  though they still count towards the Magnitude limit.  The duration of the
  original effect is tracked separately for each infected being.
  
  At Essence 4 the duration extends to (Socialize) days, and at Essence 5 to
  (Socialize) weeks.  The character can end this Charm early, but that only
  prevents the contagion spreading further, and does not stop the underlying
  effect.  Note that the contagion is a metaphysical Sickness effect and may
  be resisted as such.

  *[TODO: Should possibly have higher mins.  Compare with Lunar ``Social Unit
  Charms''.  Should possibly simplify effects a bit.]*
  
  Using this Charm, the Overseer protects a specific loyalty (Intimacy) within
  the Policy of a social group.  The character must have spent several hours
  over the previous month interacting with the group, though not necessarily
  in an obvious way.  Activating the Charm in the presence of at least one
  member of the group, the character causes a sub-group of Magnitude up to
  (character's Essence) to gain a further Intimacy to protecting the chosen
  loyalty.
  
  Any time a group Leader's Loyalty pool is reduced to zero and he implements
  some action contrary to the loyalty, causing some of the group to split off,
  two effects come into play.  First, some of the affected members will remain
  in both the original and split-off group, and work to re-join the two parts
  in subsequent scenes, and likely undo the implemented action as far as
  possible.  Secondly, those in the main group work against this foreign
  influence from within, imposing an internal penalty of (Essence รท 2) on the
  implementation of the action.
  
  Additionally, if any effect attempts to remove or weaken the protected
  loyalty, or impose another which is contradictory, the internal opposition
  helps the Leader resist this.  Assuming Loyalty can be spent to resist the
  effect, the amount of Loyalty to resist for a single scene is halved, to a
  minimum of one, and the total amount of Loyalty the Leader must spend to
  shake it off is reduced by the character's Essence, again to a minimum of
  one.  If the Leader cannot validly resist the effect, the group
  automatically loses a dot of Magnitude as the innoculated members, in a
  last-ditch attempt to protect their loyalty, all leave at once to form a new
  group.

  TODO
  
  This Charm allows the character to temporarily form a social group with a
  particular purpose, without making his involvement obvious.  The character
  first spends a few minutes interacting with a handful of people, and may do
  so non-verbally or indirectly, for example, by drawing attention to someone
  or something else, dropping an interesting item, causing a minor accident or
  similar.  On activating the Charm, he rolls [(Charisma, Manipulation or
  Appearance) + Socialize], choosing the attribute most appropriate to his
  actions.
  
  All who fail to defend against the attack form a social group of Magnitude
  up to the character's (Essence), which immediately begins to act on an
  intent of his choice.  If this intent directly conflicts with the Motivation
  of any target or would be an unacceptable order, that target is unaffected.
  He need not verbalise the intent or make it explicit in any way.  He cannot
  change the intent after the group is formed, except by further social
  attacks.
  
  At the end of the scene, the group will normally disperse, perhaps in some
  confusion at their actions.  However, if the intent matched the original
  actions or overall interests of a majority of the members, or the character
  described his actions with a particularly apt stunt, some or all of the
  group may linger.  At Essence 4, the group constitutes a temporary Cult and
  grants the character the benefits of an appropriate number of dots in that
  Background, for as long as it persists in following the intent with which it
  was seeded.  Depending on circumstances, the Storyteller may allow the
  character to spend experience to make the Cult permanent.
