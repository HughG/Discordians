  This Charm enhances a social attack, removing any DV bonuses which the
  target being or social group would gain from the attack being in opposition
  to its Intimacies, Virtues or Motivation.  Furthermore, if the attack
  succeeds and was aimed at persuading the target towards a particular belief,
  value or goal, then the attack counts as a scene spent by the target in
  building an Intimacy towards that.  Equally, if a successful attack was
  aimed at persuading the target away from an existing Intimacy, then it
  counts as a scene spend eroding it.  Characters and social groups may hold
  conflicting Intimacies, so building a new one which conflicts with an
  existing Intimacy or Motivation does not necessarily damage the latter,
  though bonuses and penalties from these conflicting values may cancel out.
  Note that, being Reflexive, this Charm can enhance rolls and be used in
  Combos with Charms from other Abilities.

  TODO
  
  This Charm enhances its prerequisite, making the mental influence unnatural,
  with either the Emotion or Illusion keyword as appropriate.  The character
  can choose to build a fully-fledged Intimacy in the target instantly, if
  her attack succeeds, but only if it conflicts in some way with one the
  target already holds.  The new Intimacy is treated as equally valid for all
  purposes.  From then on, if some effect depends on the Intimacies the target
  holds, he may regard either or both as taking effect or precedence, as he
  prefers.  Both will remain indefinitely, but a scene spent reinforcing one
  subsequently (or any other effect which reinforces it) also counts as
  weakening the other, and vice versa, unless this Charm is successfully
  applied again.  This Charm does not enhance the character's ability to wear
  away existing Intimacies.
  
  If the target holds more than his maximum number of Intimacies, then an
  Intimacy of his choice will start to fade out after the scene in which this
  Charm is invoked.  This can be any Intimacy, including the one added by this
  Charm.
  
  If the character does not know any of the target's Intimacies, or none of
  his known Intimacies suit her purposes, she may attempt to build an Intimacy
  opposing some other belief, value or goal.  If the target in fact has an
  Intimacy which matches closely enough, as determined by the Storyteller,
  then the Charm succeeds, otherwise it has no effect and the motes are
  wasted.

  This Charm adds (Socialize) to the difficulty of all attempts to read the
  character's Motivation, Intimacies, Virtue ratings, emotions or intentions
  in the current scene.  If the attempt at reading her would have succeeded
  but for this increased difficulty, the attacker will believe that it did
  succeed, and the character can determine exactly what the attacker believes
  of her in respect of whatever information would have been received.
  
  If the character's MDV would be subject to a penalty because a social attack
  aligns with her Motivation, Virtues or Intimacies, and the attacker does not
  already know these, then the penalty is reduced by (Socialize), to a minimum
  of zero.  If the attacker does already know these, this Charm will not be
  relevant.

  It is as much by trickery as by force of personality that the Tower-Builders
  drag others into their schemes.  A favorite approach is to twist words to
  persuade others that their own rebuttals do not, in fact, counter the
  Discordian's true point.
  
  This Charm renders the target's Parry Mental Defense Value inapplicable
  against the character's attack, making it unblockable.  By spending an
  additional 2 motes the character can employ this Charm to gain a
  Counterattack against any Social attack, which is again unblockable.

  The Offendis know that to get a group to cooperate, one must consider all
  members' points of view, and with the self-contradictory wisdom of Eris they
  are uniquely skilled at doing so.
  
  This Charm allows the character to briefly shift her opinion in the face of
  a social attack, her response treating it in a totally different way to what
  the attacker intended--possibly part way through a sentence which seems to
  whole-heartedly accept the point made.  The effect is to perfectly parry any
  social attack, even if it is unblockable.
  
  Additionally, at Socialize 4+, the skill with which the character renders
  her surprising response imposes an external penalty of -(Essence) on any
  further social attacks based around the same point or similar ones, from any
  character present at the time, in the following action.  This penalty
  decreases by 1 over subsequent actions until it reaches zero.

  TODO
  
  This Charm supplements a (Manipulation + Socialize) roll to establish
  surprise for a Social attack, causing it to succeed automatically unless the
  target employs supernatural senses or magic to support the opposing
  (Perception + Intelligence) roll.  In that case, the Charm still adds
  (Socialize รท 2) successes to the character's roll.
  
  Additionally, the character may use Charisma in place of Manipulation to
  establish or re-establish surprise, to indicate his skill in bending the
  topic without actually changing it.  However, each such attempt after the
  first is at a cumulative -1 internal penalty for the same topic of
  conversation in a scene.  The penalty is reset to zero at the start of a new
  scene, or by changing topic, either by dramatic statement or by rolling
  (Manipulation + Socialize) to reestablish surprise.  If the character
  returns to the same topic in the same scene, the penalty picks up where it
  left off.

  This Charm allows the character to take social actions in relation to
  targets with whom she is Joined in Battle or War.  If those Social Charms
  require observation or interaction, there must still be some line of sight,
  communication or similar between her and her targets, though they need not
  be in speaking distance.  The speed duration of Social Charms, where it is
  measured in long ticks or social actions, is scaled to the appropriate
  length for the type of physical combat.  Those whose duration is shorter or
  longer act as normal.  The impact of some actions or Charms may be limited
  at the Storyteller's discretion, and effective attacks may require some
  stunting.  For example, attempts to read an opponent's intentions may yield
  only what can be deduced from their battle cries, the things they leap to
  defend, and so on.  In mass combat, only solo units, commanders, and special
  characters can be targeted, unless the social attack targets a group.

  TODO
  
  This Charm gives the character insight into the social norms, pressures and
  desires of a group with which she is interacting.  As long as the Charm
  remains active, she reduces external penalties on actions related to
  understanding and taking advantage of knowledge of the Intimacies,
  Motivation, customs and taboos of a specific group.  The reduction is equal
  to the lower of (her Socialize) and (the Magnitude of those present who
  belong to the group).  As well as Socialize rolls (for example, to identify
  individuals who oppose the norms), this bonus can apply to other abilities.
  For example, it could apply to Larceny rolls to pass herself off as a member
  of the group, Medicine rolls to realize that a certain treatment is
  considered heretical, Bureacracy rolls to guess the local favored form of
  bribes, and so on.  Arbitration of the scope is up to the Storyteller.
  
  By default, the group to which Charm's effect relates will be the group to
  which the majority of beings visible (or otherwise clearly perceptible) to
  the Exalt consider themselves to belong.  This will most often be a local
  social grouping such as ``citizens of this town or kingdom''.  If the
  character is aware of more general or more specific groups to which most of
  those present belong, she may select one of those groups, for example,
  ``Autochthonian mortals'', ``The Guild'', ``worshippers of a specific god''.
  
  She may also opt to fish for groupings which are secret or simply unknown to
  her.  This requires a successful ([Perception or Intelligence] + Socialize)
  roll.  The difficulty is 1 but the roll is subject to an external penalty,
  determined by the Storyteller on the basis of how much effort those present
  are putting into concealing their allegiances--typically ([Manipulation +
  Socialize + Magnitude] รท 2).  If the roll fails, or no such groupings exist,
  the Charm's effect is spent.  If successful, the character will know that
  such a grouping exists, but will not automatically know anything about it,
  nor which persons present are members.  Further rolls are required, possibly
  with bonus dice from this Charm, to learn more about it.
  
  At Essence 3+ the character can apply this Charm to a group which she can
  perceive, without having to interact with them or even reveal her presence,
  though she must observe them for a scene first to do so.  At Essence 4+ the
  Magnitude of those present no longer limits the reduction of external
  penalties: she can obtain her full (Socialize) rating in reduction on the
  basis of interacting with or observing even a single individual.

  TODO
  
  Under the power of this Charm the Discordian becomes nigh indistinguishable
  from any other member of a chosen social group.
  
  The character must adopt the Policy of the group as an additional Intimacy,
  which is fully-formed by this Charm. If this leaves him with more Intimacies
  than he can sustain, he must discard another, and that Intimacy will not
  automatically return when this Charm ends. The group-related Intimacy is not
  magically protected by this Charm, and if it is eroded, the Charm ends.  It
  is however magically enhanced in that, for the duration of the Charm, any of
  the character's actions which conflict with that Intimacy suffer an external
  penalty equal to his Essence.
  
  As long as the Intimacy is maintained, the motes are committed, and the
  character fervently undertakes such actions and duties as would be expected
  of a member of the group, anyone attempting to locate or identify the
  character suffers an external penalty equal to his permanent Essence.  If an
  observer is using an effect which always succeeds, this Charm provokes a
  roll-off.  Anyone who fails will not recognize the character even if talking
  to him.  Someone attempting to find him is as likely to find a trail which
  leads to some other member of the group.  Members of the group other than
  the character will be recognised as themselves.  Effects such as Infallible
  Messenger may fail to work, or be delayed until the Charm ends. Even if the
  character claims to be himself, others will not believe it until they
  succeed on a roll, or he ends the Charm.

  If the character is the Leader of his chosen group, the penalty he suffers
  for acting against its policy is doubled, while the penalty for pursuers is
  halved.

  This Charm causes a single emotion or belief experienced by the target to
  spread to others.  The character can choose a feeling or opinion which he
  has observed or induced in the target, or allow the Storyteller to pick one.
  The target is then regarded as being infected with a disease with a
  Virulence equal to the character's Essence, and Untreated and Treated
  Morbidity ratings of zero--the disease is never directly fatal, though it
  might lead the afflicted into dangerous actions.  The Difficulty to Treat is
  equal to the character's Essence if the healer has access to relevant magic,
  otherwise (Essence x 2).

  The disease will run its course naturally in (Essence) weeks.  Once the last
  victim is released from the disease, the Charm ends.  Releasing the
  commitment of motes from this Charm ends the effects of the disease
  immediately for all who are affected.  The Magnitude of beings that can
  be affected concurrently is equal to the character's (Essence + 1).
  Furthermore, the character can maintain at most (Essence) simultaneous
  activations of this Charm.

  In the case of an emotion, infected beings are subject to a corresponding
  Emotion effect, which persists until the disease is cured.  For beliefs, the
  disease creates a fully committed Intimacy towards the belief.  If the
  Intimacy is eroded but the disease is not cured, the character will
  effectively take a commitment action every scene until it is re-esablished.

  Any action by the target which demonstrates the affected emotion or belief
  to observers is enough to provoke a resistance roll in them, lest they also
  become infected.  Even passive aspects of the target such as his appearance
  may suffice, if appropriate.  In place of the usual (Stamina + Resistance)
  roll, those subsequently exposed resist using their (Temperance + Integrity)
  against an emotion, or (Conviction + Integrity) against a belief.  An
  observer who already regards the emotion or belief positively may spend a
  point of Willpower to suppress the relevant Virtue and remove its dice from
  the resistance roll.  Those who resist or are cured become immune until the
  disease has run its course.  Note that the contagion is a metaphysical
  Sickness effect and may be resisted as such.

  Using this Charm, the Overseer protects a specific existing loyalty
  (Intimacy) within the Policy of a social group.  Activating the Charm in the
  presence of at least one member of the group--possibly the character
  himself--he causes a sebset of the group constituting a single dot of
  Magnitude to gain a further Intimacy to protecting the chosen loyalty.
  Resisting this Charm costs 5 points of Loyalty--it is hard for a leader to
  justify not supporting the organization's own goals.  A character can stack
  up to (Essence รท 2) activations of this Charm on a single group, to protect
  multiple Intimacies or to provide several layers of protection to one
  Intimacy.  However, he must pay the full cost of all activations at once,
  and the group becomes an invalid target for further activations of this
  Charm from any source, until all activations have been triggered.
  
  The Charm's effects are triggered when a group leader's Loyalty pool is
  reduced to zero and he implements some action contrary to the protected
  loyalty.  Eroding or removing the protected loyalty, or the Intimacy added
  by this Charm, are always considered contrary actions.  This causes the
  group to lose a dot of Magnitude as normal, but some of the affected members
  will side with both the main and split-off group, and two effects come into
  play.  First, those members will work to re-join the two parts.
  Mechanically, this involves taking repeated actions targeting the leader of
  the splinter group, attempting to build an Intimacy to the original leader,
  so this will take at least (splinter group leader's Conviction) scenes
  without magic.  Secondly, those reamining within the group work against the
  unorthodox action from within, imposing an internal penalty of (character's
  Essence รท 2) on the implementation of the action.

  This Charm allows the character to temporarily form a social group with a
  particular purpose, without making his involvement obvious.  The character
  first spends a few minutes interacting with a handful of people, and may do
  so non-verbally or indirectly, for example, by drawing attention to someone
  or something else, dropping an interesting item, causing a minor accident or
  similar.  On activating the Charm, he rolls [(Charisma, Manipulation or
  Appearance) + Socialize], choosing the attribute most appropriate to his
  actions.
  
  All who fail to defend against the attack form a social group of Magnitude
  up to the character's (Essence), which immediately begins to act on an
  intent of his choice.  If this intent directly conflicts with the Motivation
  of any target or would be an unacceptable order, that target is unaffected.
  He need not verbalise the intent or make it explicit in any way.  He cannot
  change the intent after the group is formed, except by further social
  attacks.
  
  At the end of the scene, the group will normally disperse, perhaps in some
  confusion at their actions.  However, if the intent matched the original
  actions or overall interests of a majority of the members, or the character
  described his actions with a particularly apt stunt, some or all of the
  group may linger.  At Essence 4, the group constitutes a temporary Cult and
  grants the character the benefits of an appropriate number of dots in that
  Background, for as long as it persists in following the intent with which it
  was seeded.  Depending on circumstances, the Storyteller may allow the
  character to spend experience to make the Cult permanent.
