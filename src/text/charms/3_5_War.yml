  *[TODO: Compare with Spell "The Battle's End".]*

  Instructing troops or comrades to avoide hostile or suspicious actions, the
  Discordian attempts to persuade one or more enemy unit(s) that his own unit
  is not a threat.  He rolls ([Charisma or Manipulation] + War) and compares
  the total against the MDV of the commander of any enemy unit he encounters
  (using War or Socialize as the relevant ability, as applicable).  As long as
  his unit does not attack, and is not observed taking opposing actions (such
  as sapping, theft of resources, poisoning of supplies etc.), enemy units
  whose MDV is less than the total rolled by the Taskmaster will not choose to
  attack, detain or otherwise or oppose his unit.  The character can choose to
  spend a point of Willpower on the Charm to give it the Compulsion keyword,
  in which case it becomes unnatural mental influence, and succeeds
  automatically against each enemy unit encountered, unless that unit's leader
  spends a point of Willpower to resist.
  
  The Charm's effects end immediately if the unit becomes engage in open
  hostilities.  If they are observed undertaking sabotage or similar indirect
  attacks, the effect ends only against those units with members who observe
  them.  The Exalt need not be the leader of a unit to employ this Charm, but
  he must be able to persuade its members to avoide hostilities.

  TODO
  
  A Knight of the Five-Sided Temple calls out to a single group which opposes
  him, decrying some other group as a worse, mutual enemy.  He must share a
  language with the target group and be able to clearly describe the supposed
  new enemy, unless that enemy is within line of sight, in which case facial
  expressions and gesturing will suffice.
  
  The Charm exerts an unnatural mental influence to persuade the target group
  will believe that they are not opposed to the character's group, but do
  oppose the indicated enemy.  The character's player rolls ([Charisma or
  Manipulation] + War) and compares the total against the MDV of the leader of
  the target group (using War as the relevant ability).  If that MDV is less
  than the total rolled by the Taskmaster, the Illusion takes effect.  The
  group leader can resist the Illusion by spending 3 points of Willpower; this
  cost drops to 1 if either the character's group is a known enemy or has
  previously been hostile, or the proposed new enemy is an existing firm ally
  of the target group.
  
  The character's group need not attack the new enemy, though the target group
  is not compelled to do so either: they will not necessarily rush in as
  cannon fodder.  The Charm's effects end immediately if the character's group
  is seen to attack the target group or aid the new enemy.  The Exalt need not
  be the leader of a unit to employ this Charm, but he must be able to
  persuade its members to avoide hostilities towards the target.

  This Charm supplements a Social attack, making it possible to use it during
  War, to directly target a commander or special character in another unit.
  Depending on whether the Social attack requires visual or verbal contact,
  the target may need to be in visual or auditory range.  The Charm
  momentarily draws the attention of the target, so these ranges are judged
  without the distractions of war, as if there were no other combatants or
  battle sounds present.  Appropriate cover, environmental effects or other
  protections may rule out the individual as a valid target, however.  This
  Charm is explicitly permitted to supplement actions from any other Ability.

  A Overseer interprets the systems around her clearly, reading in them
  patterns both hidden and unintended.  In large-scale combat this provides
  her with advantages in anticipating and interfering with an opponent's
  tactics.  As long as she keeps this Charm active, external penalties or
  difficulty modifiers due to the opposing units, or difficulty ratings based
  on the units' traits, are reduced by her Essence.  This does not directly
  affect attack and defence in most cases, since DV is not a penalty, but it
  may help in Exhaustion and Morale checks, for example.
  
  Her unit also adds (Essence) dice to any opposed rolls when an enemy unit
  attempts an ambush or other unexpected attack.  Lastly, if she witnesses a
  coded signal between enemy units, she may make an (Intelligence + War) roll
  with a difficulty equal to the War rating of the signalling unit, to get the
  gist of the message; more successes will give a clearer understanding.
  
  This Charm can be activated against only one enemy at a time.  That need not
  mean a single unit, since all the units under a given general will work
  together following some explicit pattern or inherent style.  As long as a
  number of units see themselves to be on the same side, activating this Charm
  against one makes it effective agianst all.  However, if two or more
  entirely separate powers take the field against the Bishop, she can use this
  Charm against the units of only one.  She may end the Charm at any time and
  re-activate against a different enemy.

  Drawing on the flows and filaments of chaos in the heat of battle, the
  Taskmaster instantly reshapes his unit to his liking.  Activating this Charm
  allows a unit of which he is a member to take a Change Formation, Turn,
  Split Unit or Merge Unit as a reflexive action with Speed 0, -0 DV.  For
  example, this allows a unit to apply the benefits of switching to Relaxed or
  Skirmish formation against an incoming ranged attack, before that attack is
  resolved.  If the character does not lead the unit, and the unit leader
  opposes the change, make an opposed (Charisma + War) roll between the
  character and the better of the unit's leader and its best relay.

  For the duration of this Charm, a unit containing the character finds
  themselves more in harmony with the terrain.  For the purposes of movement
  penalties, the unit treats Extreme terrain as merely Difficult, and
  Difficult terrain as Open.  Utterly impassable terrain, such as a sheer
  cliff face or solid wall, remains impassable.  Penalties from unstable
  terrain are reduced by 1, and DV bonuses from cover are increased by 1.
  These benefits apply only as long as the unit is moving or is engaged
  hand-to-hand with other units.  Staying put behind cover does not provide
  benefits, though neither does it cause the Charm to end.

  This Charm supplements a Change Formation action, allowing a unit containing
  the character to adopt a very unusual formation.  Troops form into small
  groups where two or more carry another above their heads.  This treats the
  unit as if its members were mounted (see [Core], pp. 154-155), giving the
  units members a +1 bonus to DV against close combat attacks, and enemy units
  a -1 penalty to DV if attacking in close combat.  If the unit was originally
  a standard mounted unit, these adjustments are doubled.  The Charm is not
  applicable if the unit was already mounted on beasts using howdahs.  The
  ``steeds" are treated as having a control rating of 0, and the Abilities of
  the riders are not capped by their Ride ability, since those below them
  remain equally well-trained soldiers.  The movement rate of the unit is
  reduced by 25%.

  This Charm allows a unit containing the character to make a counterattack
  against any incoming attack.  The unit may use this counterattack to attempt
  to Disengage from the enemy.  If the unit suffers rout as a result of the
  attack, the counterattack may be used to Rally for numbers, in an attempt to
  bring back some of those who are fleeing.  If instead the counterattack is
  used for a normal attack, the difficulty of any rout check is reduced by -1
  if it succeeds, as troops are heartened by their last-ditch success.  This
  Charm does not make the attacking unit a valid target for the counterattack
  if it would not otherwise be one; for example, a unit armed only with swords
  cannot respond to a ranged attack.

  This Charm temporarily increases the Might and Drill of a unit by 1, each to
  a maximum of (character's Essence).  The Exalt need not be a member of the
  unit, but it must be within line of sight.  In a Social context, this Charm
  operates on a social unit, and increases Valor and Loyalty in place of Might
  and Drill.
  
  At Essence 4, the Tower-Builder may spend an additional 4 motes and 1 point
  of Willpower to increase the Magnitude of the unit, as well as the Might and
  Drill.  In this case, the increases are not capped by the character's
  Essence.  The additional individuals required are created as a temporary
  Shaping effect, twisting the fabric of reality to cause extra points of
  agency to appear.  They appear as normal for the group, but are unreal,
  soulless beings, similar to those produced by Wyld-shaping magic.  This
  increase in Magnitude cannot be applied to solo units.  When the Charm's
  effect ends, the extra members of the unit vanish without a trace.
