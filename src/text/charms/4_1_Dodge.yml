  The phrase, ``I didn't do it!'', is a blunt and blatant excuse which
  captures the essence of all excuses, and with just the right amount of charm
  it can be made to work.  By activating this particular Charm, the Unhinged
  are able to prevent a counterattack taking place.  This is not a defence
  against the attack, rather it removes the character as a valid target for a
  counterattack.  Thus the attacker will not waste any motes or other
  expenditure on their counterattack.  Also, it means that this Charm avoids
  perfect attacks made as part of a counterattack.

  Those who throw themselves at the Foolish Sages may find themselves the
  greater fools.  A character may employ this Charm whenever he uses his Dodge
  DV against an attack, successfully or not, provided the opponent is within
  touching distance.  This is assumed to be true unless the attack was ranged.
  A momentary magical redistribution of forces gives the attacker a penalty of
  -(character's Essence) to his Dodge DV until his next action, and a -1
  external penalty on his next attack roll (but not damage roll).

  TODO
  
  This Charm attempts to confuse an attacker as to the character's exact
  location--and, there being a need for balance in all things, arange for
  someone else to take the fall.  If the character attempts to dodge an attack
  and fails, she may activate this Charm to cause the attack to be re-rolled
  against any other valid target.  If there are no other valid targets, the
  attack fails altogether.

  This Charm is not applicable against attacks which are undodgeable.  The
  attacker may ignore the unnatural mental influence of this Charm by spending
  two points of temporary Willpower.

  fails.

  Against the greatest of opponents, it may not be enough to trick reality
  instead.  Skilled Discordians will tweak space and time, as well as their
  opponent's minds, to evade blades and blows.

  This Charm causes the character to flicker momentarily into and back out of
  Elsewhere, perfectly dodging any attack, even if it is undodgeable.  A
  second purchase at Essence 4+ allows the character to spend an additional
  two motes and one point of Willpower to redirect his opponent's attack
  through Elsewhere, to any other valid target within (Dodge) yards, excluding
  the attacker herself.

  This Charm has one of the Discordian Flaws of Invulnerability.

  Not everything can be done with smoke and mirrors, but they come in handy in
  a pinch.  With this Charm, the Foolish Sage appears to split into a number
  of smoky, slightly translucent duplicates of himself, so he appears as up to
  (Essence) beings in total.  Assuming an attack is successful at Step 4, the
  attacker must roll his (Perception + Awareness) against a difficulty of the
  character's Essence at Step 5 of the attack.  Failure means that she struck
  one of the smoky duplicates instead, which immediately vanishes.  For a
  flurry or multiple attack sequence, or for multiple attackers, each action
  requires a separate roll to succeed, and will eliminate a separate duplicate
  if it fails.

  Any attack or counterattack the character makes while the duplicates are
  active is copied by all of them, so defenders suffer an external penalty
  to their Defense Values equal to (number of remaining duplciates รท 2).
  
  At any point the attacker may spend a point of Willpower to ignore the
  Illusion, after which no further rolls are required to attack, and no
  further penalties are applied to defense.  Similarly, once all the
  duplicates are destroyed, subsequent interactions proceed as normal.  If any
  duplicates remain at the end of the scene, the Charm ends and they
  disappear.  The character may end the illusion reflexively at any time.
  Otherwise, the essence for the Charm remains committed until all duplicates
  are gone.
  
  An attack which is unblockable or undodgeable will always hit the true
  target, leaving any remaining duplicates unchanged.  Also, area effects,
  environmental hazards and ongoing sources of damage such as poison are not
  affected.

  Erisians laugh in the face of danger (or sometimes behind its back), and
  laugh all the louder when it comes from all sides.  This Charm is used
  against coordinated attacks, multiple attacks and flurries.  Until his next
  action, penalties to the character's DV from coordinated attacks or
  onslaught instead become bonuses, for the purposes of dodging.
  
  If hemmed in by multiple opponents, possibly in combination with restrictive
  terrain, the character replaces the usual -2 DV penalty with a +2 DV bonus.
  If the opponents make coordinated or multiple attacks, further bonuses may
  apply, as above.  Furthermore, no attack from any of those opponents can be
  unexpected (though ranged attacks or area effects from elsewhere may be).
  
  For the avoidance of doubt, the DV bonuses from this Charm do not apply to
  area or environmental effects.

  *[TODO: more fluff]*

  Some of the most powerful Mid-day Shadows go even futher in turning their
  enemies' hostility against them.
  
  This Charm extends the effects of Villain Multiplication Nature to a whole
  scene.  In addition, if the character tries but fails to dodge a single
  attack (i.e., without a flurry or multiple attack effect) from a single
  opponent, he gains a +1 bonus to Dodge DV until the end of the scene.  This
  bonus accumulates from action to action, and remains until the scene ends.
  As with the prerequisite Charm, area, environmental and undodgeable attacks
  are not included (unless by some other Charm in a Combo).

  TODO
  
  This Charm allows the Unhinged to instantly transport herself for a short
  distance, if she has attempted to dodge an attack, regardless of whether or
  not she succeeds.  The distance is determined by rolling the charcter's
  (Wits + Dodge) and multiplying the successes by her normal Move distance.
  This movement happens instantly, going via Elsewhere, but uses up the
  character's Move action.
  
  The character can choose the direction of movement but must travel the full
  distance rolled, and must know (or at least firmly believe) that there is a
  surface at the destination which is able to safely support her.  Water will
  suffice, if she might reasonably be able to swim, though acid normally would
  not.  There need not be a clear path to the endpoint, and indeed this Charm
  can move the character through solid walls etc.  Intentional movement into
  midair is not possible, although it might happen accidentally if the
  character is mistaken in her beliefs about the terrain.
  
  This Charm cannot be used except when dodging, and does not by itself defend
  against perfect or undodgeable attacks.  It is perfectly acceptable to use
  this Charm to appear behind an opponent.  The movement is as silent as it is
  instant, so an unexpected attack on the next action may be possible.  This
  Charm is resolved as a Counterattack, even though it is not hostile; it
  cannot be used with a counterattack and it reduces the character's DV by 1.

  Discordians often work alone, but friends are important, too.
  
  This Charm upgrades its prerequisite, allowing the Unhinged to apply it to a
  group of beings (or like-sized objects) up to (character's Essence) in
  Magnitude.  The group need not be a pre-existing unit, but it must include
  the character.  Unwilling targets may choose to remain where they are.  Used
  in this fashion, the Charm cost increases by one point of Willpower, plus 3
  motes per dot of Magnitude of the group.
  
  The distance in this case determined by rolling the charcter's (Wits +
  Dodge) and multiplying the successes by her normal Dash (not Move) distance.
  The Charm can only be applied in response to an attack on (or an area attack
  which includes) any member of the group, and only when it would be valid for
  the character herself (who may not be the actual target) to try to dodge the
  attack.  The group must travel the full distance, and the distance is
  measured from the outside of the group, not its centre.
