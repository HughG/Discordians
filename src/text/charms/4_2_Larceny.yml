  TODO
  
  Opening a controlled pocket of Elsewhere, the character places into it any
  non-living item which she can easily hold in her hand.  While inside this
  pocket, the item cannot be found by normal means.  It can be retrieved as a
  miscellaneous action, though the character may keep the motes committed to
  allow her to return the item to storage, again as a miscellaneous action.
  If she simply releases the committment, the item falls to the ground beside
  her.
  
  A character can store away at most (Essence) items in this manner, each
  requiring a separate activation of this Charm.  A second purchase at Essence
  3 allows the character to stash away any object which she could lift with a
  feat of strength.  With Larceny 4 and Essence 4, this second purchase
  automatically extends to allowing the character to stash away a willing (and
  presumably trusting) living being, by spending a point of Willpower in
  addition to the mote cost.  For them, no time will seem to have passed when
  they are retrieved.

  TODO
  
  This Charm allows the Mid-day Shadow to exercise her pickpocketing skills
  through a small twist of Elsewhere, retrieving an object despite any mundane
  barriers which lie between her and the target.  She can retrieve an object
  up to (Essence) yards away, provided it is not within an area warded against
  teleportation.  Any other barriers or wards will not stop her theft.  Alarms
  triggered by the presence of something will stay dormant, though one
  triggered by the absence of the stolen item would activate.
  
  Objects which are firmly held, such as weapons in use, cannot be taken with
  this Charm, nor can attuned artifacts.  Furthermore, the conduit it provides
  is not sufficient to allow feats of strength to be exercised through it.  If
  the character is removing an item from someone's person, treat this as a
  pickpockting attempt, with the base difficulty of the (Dexterity + Larceny)
  roll being 1.  The difficulty is not increased by inanimate bindings.
  Objects in plain sight have difficulty 2, with success indicating that
  observers were distracted.  Victims might notice the theft immediately, but
  attempts to realise who carried out the theft, or where the object went, are
  at +5 to difficulty.
  
  The character must have a reasonably accurate idea of the location of the
  item before this Charm can be used.

  TODO
  
  This Charm builds upon its prerequisite, allowing the Gatekeeper to
  instantly change places with a target object or being within (Essence x 5)
  yards.  Wards against teleportation will prevent this effect.  Unwilling
  beings can resist as if resisting a grapple, but at an external penalty of
  -(character's Essence x 2), since the attack comes from no particular
  direction.  Objects are only valid targets if they could be lifted by the
  character as a feat of strength, using (Strength + Athletics + Essence).
  
  If the character or the target was restrained before the exchange, those
  restraints will switch from one to the other, though they may break or be
  too loose.

  TODO
  
  Activating this Charm swaps one idea from the target's surface thoughts with
  another from the Foolish Sage's own.  The character need not touch or lock
  eyes with the target, but his target must be within (Essence x 5) yards and
  clearly perceptible to him.  The target may resist, making an opposed roll
  of (Wits + Integrity) against the character's (Wits + Larceny + Essence).
  If the target succeeds, he or she experiences a brief moment of distraction
  but is otherwise unaffected.  If not, the character takes one thought or
  idea from the target's surface mind and exchanges it with one of his own
  choosing, from his own mind.
  
  The character cannot be certain what surface thoughts he will find, but must
  proceed with the exchange if the target fails the roll.  A wise Fool will
  therefore prime his own mind with some important and unimportant surface
  thoughts in advance.  A willing target may choose not to resist, in which
  case this Charm can be used for silent communication, of an odd sort.  An
  idea planted in a target's head can be used as a basis for enhancing
  relevant stunts in the same scene, adding an extra die (to the normal
  maximum of 3) if the Storyteller judges that the new notion supports them.
  
  The ideas exchanged cannot be fundamental to the individuals concerned,
  e.g., in support of Motivation or Intimacies, nor can they counter awareness
  of an ongoing situation, overcome survival instincts or the like.  For
  example, a character could not cause a Dragon-Blooded target to temporarily
  lose his hatred of Anathema, nor to ignore a glowing Solar Caste mark on the
  character's forehead, nor to ignore the character as an enemy in an ongoing
  battle.  However, the Charm could steal away suspicions that the character
  _might_ be Anathema, or might be carrying concealed weapons, provided there
  was no ongoing evidence to support it.
  
  The effect is not strong enough to blind either party to reality: if some
  new event occurs to support the idea, someone else points it out, or
  similar, he will regain it.  In any case, the original ideas will come back
  to each after the scene ends, and the replacements will remain in memory.
  The target is likely to treat the replacement thought as an unexpected idea
  of his own, unless he has some reason to suspect mental tampering.
  
  If used as a defense in social combat, this Charm adds 2 to the character's
  MDV, even if it fails, since he knows that the distraction is coming,
  whereas the target does not.
  
  This Charm cannot be used against automata, although it can be used against
  manses or warstriders which have an animating intelligence.

  This Charm supplements an action to create a disguise, enabling the
  character to do so in a single action, rather than the many minutes it would
  normally require, and use even the most tenuously applicable of props.  The
  character gains (Larceny) additional successes on the roll to construct the
  disguise.  Note that the character's Recumbent Destiny applies as normal.

  TODO
  
  This Charm supplements a Larceny action to allow the construcion of a
  disguise, to apply to an object, disguising one item as another of roughly
  equivalent size, shape and weight.  This explicitly allows a disguise which
  would normally be wildly improbable.  For example, a chest of drawers could
  be disguised as a sleeping cow.
  
  The disguise is not quite perfect but the character gains (Larceny)
  successes on the roll to disguise the object.  The apparent Resources value
  of the object can be decreased by as much as (Larceny), to a minimum of
  zero, but cannot be increased except in the case where the Mid-day Shadow is
  constructing a forgery of a specific item, which requires access to or
  detailed information on the object to be copied.  In this case, the increase
  can be no greater than (Larceny รท 2), to a maximum of 5.

  The base version of this Charm does not carry the Illusion keyword and
  cannot disguise the magical nature of things like artifacts, so those with
  Essence sight might gain bonuses to attempts to see the true nature of a
  magical item.  Then again, a cunning Discordian might just choose to
  disguise a famous daiklave as an ordinary daiklave of the same magical
  material.

  A second purchase at Essence 3 adds the Illusion keyword and lets the
  character apply this Charm to artifacts, hearthstones, talismans and other
  magical items, either to make a unique item appear generic, or even
  concealing magical items as mundane.  The character can create an Illusion
  which removes unique features from an artifact's appearance, or reduces the
  apparent Artifact rating of an item by up to (Larceny) dots, to a minimum of
  zero, or both.  This Illusion costs 2 points of Willpower to resist.

  TODO
  
  This Charm supplements a Disguise action in which the character attempts to
  make herself up as some non-human being of roughly equivalent size, be it of
  animal, spirit, demon or some other sort.  It removes any increases in
  difficulty to the roll due to noticeable differences in size or gender, as
  well as body type, although attempting to look like a specific individual
  still adds +1 to the difficulty.  The natural senses of animals, demons
  etc. gain them no bonuses in seeing through the deception, but supernatural
  senses will help as normal.  The disguise does not affect the character's
  Essence signature, but all Discordians may use their innate abilities to
  disguise that.

  TODO
  
  This powerful Charm allows One Who Stands in the Doorway to take the
  identity of another: not simply to copy their appearance, but possibly also
  to remove their unique self from them.  Doing so requires a resisted roll of
  the character's (Willpower + Larceny + Essence) against the target's (Wits +
  Integrity + Essence).  A willing target may accept the effect without
  resisting.
  
  Provided the character gains at least one success on his roll, he becomes
  seemingly identical to the target, to all natural senses.  This includes
  apparently duplicating all mundane and magical equipment.  Magical equipment
  will be non-functional, though it will bear the appropriate Essence
  signature; or, if the character possesses a reasonably similar artifact, he
  may cloak it in the identity of part of the target's panoply.  Beings with
  inhumanly acute senses may make a Perception + Awareness roll to spot an
  imperfection in this mimicry, with no bonuses.  Those with magical senses
  such as Essence sight may also do so, with a +2 bonus.  The character's
  Recumbent Destiny functions as normal, so this imposturing may be forgotten
  once the character leaves.  If the character and target are both within
  Fate, their strands appears to be entwined; if one or other is outside Fate,
  the other strand appears frayed.
  
  If character gains at least one threshold success over the target, or the
  target does not resist, that being is immediately subject to an effect
  similar to those of a Recumbent Destiny.  All beings apart from the
  character himself who observe the target must make a (Wits + Occult) roll at
  a difficulty equal to the number of threshold successes.  If they fail, they
  will not later accurately recall the presence, identity or actions of the
  target over the duration, or even perceive them accurately while the target
  is still present.  Even if the target's presence is noted, her identity will
  appear to be that of some miscellaneous extra, rather than her own.
  Protestations from the victim do not give any bonus on this roll.

  TODO
  
  The value or desirability of an object can be increased (or decreased) by
  application of this Charm.  It casts an Illusion or Emotion effect over some
  item, which subtly changes how it is perceived in one of two ways.
  
  In the simpler case, the character may choose to increase the item's
  apparent Resources value by up to her (Larceny รท 2), to a maximum of 5, or
  decrease it by her (Larceny), to a minimum of 0.  Anyone may spend one point
  of Willpower to see through this Illusion; if they then point it out to
  others, they will immediately see through it as well.
  
  Alternatively, she may use an Emotion effect to make it more viscerally
  appealing.  At the time the Charm is acivated, the character rolls his
  (Manipulation + Larceny + Essence) and records the number of successes.  All
  who observe the item while the Charm remains active (apart from the
  character himself) are subject to unnatural mental influence attack with
  that number of successes, which they must defend against with their Dodge
  MDV.  If their Dodge MDV is less, they gain a desire to obtain the item,
  though not necessarily immediately.  The strength of the desire depends on
  the number of successes above the threshold.  Again, observers may spend a
  point of Willpower to shake off this desire, but doing so does not give them
  a way to free others from the effect, since it is only their own desire
  which is affected.  On the other hand, the character may free specific
  others from this effect by telling them about it, before or after using the
  Charm.
