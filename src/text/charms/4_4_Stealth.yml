  The Mid-Day Shadows use this Charm to turn the tables--or other convenient
  objects--on those who would try to uncover or spoil their schemes.  The
  character activates it reflexively and subconsciously to notice any
  concealed living beings observing him within ([Stealth + Essence] x 10)
  yards.  He gains (Essence) automatic successes on a reflexive (Perception +
  [Awareness or Stealth]) roll to spot any living being watching him.  This
  effect can contest perfect concealment effects.  Immaterial observers are
  not valid targets, unless the character has some way to see such beings.

  At Essence 3 the character is able to realize that he is being observed via
  non-living beings like automata and undead.  He can also notice use of
  indirect means such as scrying or artifacts, in which case he can try to
  find the local viewpoint of the effect (if it provides observation from a
  point) but cannot locate the original observer unless they are within the
  Charm's normal range.  At Essence 4 this extends to passive recording, be it
  by use of magitech, sorcery, or other means.
  
  In many cases this Charm can remove the quality of surprise from ambushes
  and similar attacks, but not all.  Surprise attacks by apparently friendly
  beings in plain sight will remain so, as will those by automated magitech
  systems or magical wards which do not specifically observe targets in the
  area they affect.  Similarly, this Charm will not reveal concealed or
  scrying beings who are not observing the character, for example, those
  looking in a different direction.  In all cases the Storyteller's decision
  is final.

  The character adopts a position and stance which enable him to fit into his
  current environment, and activates this Charm, helping him appear to be part
  of the scenery.  Firstly, it removes all penalties to contested Stealth
  rolls due to an inappropriate environment (for example, lack of cover).
  Secondly, it adds (Stealth รท 2) automatic successes to all such rolls.
  Lastly, it allows him to use Manipulation in place of Dexterity when making
  the Stealth roll, if desired.  Other beings will not normally walk into the
  character accidentally, since they see him but do not recognise him for what
  he is, subliminally assuming him to be a lamp, bush, dead body or other
  appropriate item.  Effects which reveal information contradicting this may
  give a bonus to those attempting to notice the character, such as those
  which detect life or essence.
  
  This Charm ends immediately if the character moves, makes some sensory
  impression greater than the background level, activates an Obvious Charm, or
  takes a Join Battle action.  If joining battle he may apply the benefits of
  this Charm to an unexpected attack as his first action.  The concealment
  enhancements offered by this Charm have no effect on those who were able to
  perceive the character in the tick before he activated it, so the character
  cannot use it to reestablish surprise during battle without first finding
  some other way to hide.

  This Charm allows the character to draw a twisting, fractal-folded shroud of
  the unfabric of Elsewhere around her form, almost entirely removing her from
  the reality in which she stands.  While hidden she cannot move with respect
  to her original location, and will always reappear there when the Charm
  ends.
  
  All mundane attempts to observe or interact with her automatically fail,
  meaning that mortals may walk right through the space she previously
  occupied.  Charms or other magic which attempt to locate her, or hidden
  things, or the magic of the Charm itself, have their base difficulty
  increased to her (Stealth + Essence) if it would otherwise be less.  If
  detection succeeds, the character's location is determined with an accuracy
  of ([threshold successes - character's Stealth] x 5) yards, to a minimum of
  pinpoint accuracy at zero yards.  Against automatically successful effects
  such as Eye of the Unconquered Sun, this Charm forces a contested roll and
  adds the character's Stealth in automatic successes.
  
  While concealed, the character cannot be spatially targeted for any actions
  other than attempts to locate her.  Even once her location is precisely
  known, she cannot be targeted with physical weapons, even magical ones, or
  Touch effects.  Damage and other unpleasant effects from natural area
  effects are completely negated, while those from magical sources are delayed
  (Essence) actions as the magic must work its way through strange folds of
  space to reach the character.  If the character notices such an effect and
  deactivates the Charm before it reaches her, she is unaffected, though the
  effect might still be active in her original location.
  
  The downside of this Charm is that the character's isolation works both
  ways, so she suffers a -4 external penalty to perceive events in her
  original location, including magical area effects which might hurt her after
  a delay.  She cannot target anything or anyone there with any individually
  targeted or area actions or effects, mundane or magical, other than to
  observe them.
  
  Effects which allow someone to see into Elsewhere completely bypass this
  Charm's concealment, but do not normally work around the protection from
  damage it provides.  It is not possible for the character to use any magical
  effects which guarantee absolute success to see out from under her cloak,
  though she may enhance her senses, including use of the second excellency.
  Effects which target a being as a unique individual or through some arcane
  or other remote link also completely bypass this Charm's shield, in either
  direction, and are not delayed by it.  The character is not made immaterial
  by this Charm and so is not specially affected by magic which targets such
  beings.

  The magic of this Charm hides a single object, or set of similar objects, on
  the character's person which would otherwise be in plain sight. The line of
  a sword will appear to vanish into the shifting fold lines of the
  character's clothes, the boots on his feet will seem but as weathered skin,
  or the crown on his head look like spiked or rumpled hair, or vanish
  altogether. Resisting this Illusion costs 3 Willpower, which must be paid
  all at once on first observing the Illusion, or when further chances to
  resist arise, as described below.
  
  The hidden objects still exist, and the Charm's magic does not hide their
  effects.  Those apparently bare feet will leave boot-prints, and onlookers
  will see arrows which are loosed from a concealed bow materialize a short
  way along their flight.  At Essence 2, the Charm's concealment ends a foot
  or so from the body, for anything no longer in contact with the character.
  With Essence 3+, the character can spend a point of Willpower in addition to
  the mote cost to extend this range to (Essence x 5) yards.
  
  The first time in a scene that someone observes a visible effect of a
  concealed item, that observer gains another opportunity to resist the
  Illusion.  Different effects from later actions may provide further
  opportunities. Similarly, the first time in a scene that an observer sees
  the character do something which relies on the existence of the hidden
  object, she has another opportunity. For example, shooting a concealed bow
  would allow observers one chance to resist and, if the arrow passed beyond
  the Charm's range, each would each gain another chance.  Later shots in the
  scene would not afford more chances to resist, unless they had new
  consequences, such as killing someone within the Charm's range.
  
  Anyone attacked using a hidden object suffers an external penalty of
  (Stealth รท 2) to Defense Values.  The concealment may also be used to make
  an initial attack unexpected.  Thereafter, targets are aware that they are
  being attacked with some kind of weapon, even if they can't quite make it
  out.  The DV penalty from this Charm decreases by one after each attack the
  character makes, to a minimum of zero.  Any time a target is attacked, she
  gains another attempt to resist the Illusion, and any time an attack on her
  hits, the Willpower cost for her is reduced by one, to a minimum of one.

  This Charm improves its prerequisite, allowing it to be applied to a group
  of beings up to the character's (Essence - 1) in Magnitude, or to one or
  more inanimate objects in a volume of space roughly equivalent in size to
  that number of humans, or any equivalent combination of beings and objects.
  Observers who fail to see through the concealment will intepret the group as
  some larger innocuous background object, such as a hedge or pile of rubble.
  
  Additionally, the group may take Move, but not Dash, actions at up to a
  third of its normal movement rate.  Doing so does not automatically break
  concealment but prompts another (Perception + Awareness) roll from observers
  and gives them a +2 dice circumstance bonus: observers may not see the group
  as a moving large object, but may become suspicious and notice that it
  doesn't quite seem to be in the same place at different points in time.  The
  character may use this Charm on himself alone to allow movement while
  concealed.  If the Charm is deactivated once those concealed have found some
  other suitable cover, it provides no benefits on further Awareness checks,
  but ending the Charm does not in itself prompt such a check.
  
  Used in War, the Charm has a Speed of 5 long ticks and may conceal any unit
  that the character is a member of, not only one he leads, though he must be
  able to persuade the unit to act in such a way as not to counteract the
  concealment.  The Charm is not limited to a given Magnitude of unit but,
  similar to normal attempts at concealment in battle, the character rolls
  ([Dexterity or Manipulation] + Stealth - Magnitude).  The unit need not have
  cover but, if it does, the Storyteller may assign additional bonuses, for
  example treating any DV bonuses against ranged attaks (Exalted Core, p. 147)
  as providing equivalent bonus dice to the roll.

  This Charm allows the character to extend an application of his Recumbent
  Destiny to a social or mass combat group, up to a Magnitude equal to his
  Essence, blurring others' memories of that group.  If any of the group are
  unaware that this effect is being applied, or unwilling, the character must
  roll his ([Dexterity, Manipulation, or Wits] + Stealth) and compare it to
  the group's Dodge MDV, disregarding any bonuses due to relative Magnitude.
  If the roll succeeds, each member of the group, and the group as a whole if
  it has a known identity, is subject to the same effects as normally apply
  when a Discordian covers his tracks in this manner.  The character must have
  observed either the majority of the group, or its leader acting in that
  formal capacity, at the chosen onset time, or be observing them now.
  Sufficiently detailed records of the past, such as memory crystals or
  magically extracted memories, might stand in for past observation, at the
  Storyteller's discretion.  Scrying and other indirect magic are acceptable
  means of current observation.

  This Charm damps, overloads, or otherwise interferes with perception of the
  character in any one of the five senses, and it may be activated multiple
  times to affect several senses together.  The character might shroud herself
  in silence, enhance one small part of her scent profile massively to trick
  pursuing beasts, or surround herself with a flurry of lights and shadows to
  make it harder to identify her.  The effect is to impose an external penalty
  equal to her permanent Essence on all attempts using the relevant sense to
  track, identify, target or--if the sense is suppressed--even detect her.
  Choosing the sense of touch will not prevent others from locating her by
  touch, but it will make her feel like something other than she appears.
  This Charm only provides confusion, so it cannot be used for fashioning a
  disguise, projecting a detailed image, mimicking a particular scent or
  similar fine work.

  With the trait minimums required for this Charm, its effects cover only the
  character's immediate person, including whatever she is wearing or carrying.
  At Stealth 4, she can extend it to cover a radius of up to (Essence x 2)
  yards.  She must choose the range when activating the Charm, and cannot
  change it thereafter, the effect remaining centered on her if she moves.  At
  Essence 4+, if multiple activations of the Charm are stacked the Willpower
  cost applies only to the first activation.  A second purchase at Essence 4+
  allows the Charm to be applied to almost any other exotic senses one could
  imagine, limited only by the Storyteller.  Heat vision, echolocation, and
  Essence sight are certainly among those affected.

  Power which reveal information via the senses may or may not be affected,
  depending on how they work and whether they require a roll which fails due
  to this Charm's penalty.  For example, the Malfean Charm Insignificant
  Embers Intuition is based on noticing sensory details, so this Charm might
  defeat it.  On the other hand, while this Charm might prevent others from
  hearing the character's words, it would not directly contest the Pyrian
  power of Factual Determination Analysis, if applied by an Infernal who
  managed to hear her clearly.
  
  This Charm was originally developed to help with mimicry of certain castes
  of other Exalt types, but creative Discordians have found many other uses
  for it.

  This Charm twists apparent reality around the Discordian, but only from the
  point of view of those viewing or targeting him magically from afar.  This
  includes but--at the Storyteller's discretion--is not limited to the
  Thaumaturgical Procedure of Scrying, certain Sorcery and artifacts, Charms
  which extend the range of existing senses, observation via the Loom of Fate,
  and use of an arcane link to the character to target him with some effect.
  The character may activate this Charm reflexively whenever he is targeted by
  such an effect.  The difficulty of the action is increased by his Essence.
  If the activity does not normally require a roll this Charm forces a
  resisted roll, pitting his ([Manipulation or Wits] + Stealth) against an
  appropriate roll for the observer.  The difficulty for the character is 1
  but for the observer it is equal to the character's Essence.  If the
  activity requires an extended roll, this increased difficulty applies for
  all rolls, though this Charm is activated only once.

  If a distant observer succeeds in making contact, he or she becomes a valid
  target for the character's Recumbent Destiny later on.  In the case of
  someone using an arcane link to target the character, the attacker must
  succeed in such a contested roll, or else the item fails to act as a link on
  that occasion.  If the roll is botched, it becomes possible for the
  character to use the link in the opposite direction, and he will be aware of
  this.

  This Charm wraps the Exalt's normal self inside another, constructed
  personality and body, enabling her to act as a deep-cover agent over a
  prolonged period.
  
  Her identity is buried so deeply that even she will not be aware of who she
  truly is.  On activation she must specify at least one trigger condition
  which will cause the Charm to end, and may specify up to (Essence)
  independent triggers.  The condition must be one which her new identity
  would be able to perceive and understand, in terms of normal and magical
  senses, languages known and so on.  It can be as simple or as complex as
  desired, but will only be triggered when the new identity becomes aware of
  it.  So, for example, a trigger to end the Charm ``when the Jade Prison is
  broken'' would only take effect when the new self learned that it had
  happened, not when it actually occurred.  Indeed, it would trigger when he
  believed that it had happened, even if the prison was in fact still sealed.
  Similarly, ``when I meet Chejop Kejak's murderer'' would trigger when the
  new self believed that he had met someone who had committed that murder,
  even if they had not, nor if he met the murderer but didn't realise it.
  
  The character may choose any of the following types of being for her new
  self: another Discordian of the same Division and Parametadivision, having
  up to her current Essence; a being of the type which her Parametadivision
  mimics, again having up to her current Essence; a mortal or unenlightened
  heroic mortal up to Essence 2 (or equivalent unenlightened being in any
  realm of reality); or even a god, spirit, demon or similar being not
  belonging to a Parametadivision, up to her current Essence, although this
  choice is risky because she is granted no particular magic to mimic the
  powers of such beings.
  
  If the character chooses an unenlightened identity, she cannot spend motes
  except to subconsiously activate non-Obvious Reflexive Charms using her
  Personal pool.  She will interpret these powers as moments of good fortune.
  Other expenditures will end the Charm.  Applying or resisting unnatural
  mental influence still gains the character points of Hodge and Podge while
  in her disguised form, though she will be unaware of their effects and may
  not understand when she enters Limit Break.  Any magical effects which have
  made certain things unacceptable orders, beyond those which would harm her,
  still apply to her new self.
  
  The new self may have any physical appearance appropriate to the chosen type
  of being, with the same Appearance rating.  The Charm cannot perfectly
  duplicate another being's form, though it can create someone reasonably
  similar in appearance.
  
  Donning this new guise, the character is subject to a reversed Recumbent
  Destiny effect, as powerful as if she had spent her full temporary Willpower
  pool on it.  Memories and minor details of reality are shaped to make it
  seem that this new identity has existed since the onset time of the
  Recumbent Destiny, and those affected will remember the new face clearly.
  Attempts to find the character with the Loom of Fate are not impeded.
  Instead the increased difficulty applies if anyone tries to follow the
  thread back to the original identity.
  
  The Discordian's new self has the same Traits as her original self, except
  for Motivation, Intimacies and Backgrounds.  The new identity has an
  entirely new Motivation, selected by the character when the Charm is
  activated.  Likewise new Intimacies are selected, under the control of the
  Storyteller, though the player may make suggestions.  The character loses
  access to all her existing Backgrounds except for Artifact and Manse (and
  its Underworld and Heavenly variants), and will lose even Manse if she
  chooses an unenlightened identity.  However, she gains up to 15 dots of
  Backgrounds appropriate to her new identity.  Those involving power and
  other people cannot extend beyond the Magnitude of people affected by the
  reversed Recumbent Destiny effect which accompanies this Charm.
  
  At Essence 5+, this hiding of self persists even after death.  The
  character's death will not end the Charm's effects and, if the Storyteller
  decides that Discordian Exaltations pass on to new hosts, then the new host
  will not experience the effects of Exaltation, or be aware of his power,
  until the trigger conditions are satisfied.  This may be part of the reason
  why no Erisian Exalts have been seen for a long time.
  
  Lastly, this Charm is Stackable: the character can activate as many
  simultaneous hidden identities at once as her temporary Willpower pool
  affords her.  The stacking of these identities must be decided in advance,
  so that triggering the end of one will shift her to another preselected one,
  losing the first completely.  The reversed Recumbent Destiny effect is
  triggered at the same time, so that her new identity is more likely to be
  accepted.
