  This Charm extends the maximum range of a Thrown weapon, stretching out its
  flight path by sending it on many momentary hops through Elsewhere.
  Spending two motes on this Charm doubles the maximum range, spending three
  triples it, and so on up to a maximum multiple of the character's Essence.
  However, shots beyond double the base range suffer an external penalty of
  -1, and beyond triple this range a penalty of -2 applies (which is still an
  improvement on the default penalties, as described on <<Exalted>>, p. 148).

  They Who Stand in the Doorway surprise their foes by stepping out at just
  the right time, apparently from nowhere--or possibly just by sticking out a
  foot.  Likewise they can send their knives and needles through evanescent
  entrances and exits of Elsewhere.

  This Charm supplements a Thrown attack in a number of ways.  It makes the
  attack automatically unexpected, unless the target has some way of seeing
  into Elsewhere.  It also effectively allows attacks to pass through solid
  objects, although it does not by itself allow the character to accurately
  target through them.

  At Essence 4+, whether or not the weapon strikes its target, the character
  may choose to open one last little doorway which causes it to reappear
  anywhere within a sphere centered on the target and with a radius equal to
  the full range of the attack.  This can include reappearing directly above
  the target, in which case the character gains a free extra attack with that
  weapon on her next action, as it falls onto the target.  This attack is at a
  -2 external penalty and has its the applied Strength capped at one tenth the
  number of yards above the target at which the weapon appears, since it is
  gravity which propels the weapon.  If the target moves substantially before
  the character's next action, the storyteller may rule that the target avoids
  the attack automatically--or, given a clever stunt, walks straight into it.
  This extension of the Charm can also be used to return the weapon to the
  character's hand.

  *[TODO: Should this also have attack buffs like <<Thrown_bpp>>, since it can
  be mimed?  Or should it always be mimed?  Probably ...]*

  The character activates this Charm by making or miming a Thrown attack
  targeting a being, object or location.  Her attack must hit but need not
  cause any damage.  For the rest of the scene, she can control an Illusion
  which is situated at the target point, and can produce visual, auditory or
  olfactory manifestations of the character, using his appearance at the time
  the Charm was activated.  The Illusion may be anything from a clear image of
  the character to subtle hints of her presence--shadows, creaking floorboards
  and the like.  If it targets a fixed object or location, the Illusion cannot
  move, but moving objects or beings will carry it with them.

  Initially the character chooses a simple manifestation, containing nothing
  more complex than a handful of words, and sets it to repeat at a regular or
  slightly random interval, at her choice.  She may take a miscellaneous
  action to change the content, in which case she must flurry to take any
  other non-reflexive actions at the same time.  Alternatively she may take
  full and detailed control of it, one action at a time, although this
  inflicts a -2 internal penalty on any other actions in a flurry.

  The character rolls [(Intelligence or Manipulation) + Thrown], and all
  observers whose MDV is less than the successes on that roll are taken in by
  the Illusion.  Even those who are not will be distracted for the action on
  which the Charm is activated, suffering a -2 external penalty to attempts to
  observe or attack the character.  Resisting the Illusion costs two
  Willpower.  The illusion does not include a tactile component, so anyone who
  attempts to strike or otherwise touch it automatically sees through it, and
  anyone who observes this forces another roll of the aforementioned dice
  pool, giving them another chance to ignore it.  Also, since the
  manifestation will not react intelligently without the character's input,
  the storyteller may judge that a lack of response to others' actions also
  allows them another roll, or automatic success, to see through it.

  Against those who are fooled, the character adds her Essence in dice to
  attempts to attack from surprise, or to re-establish surprise, and to any
  Stealth rolls against them.  Suitable stunts may justify other bonuses or
  benefits according to the storyteller's judgement.  One can also use the
  illusion to do such things as lure others away from the character, or
  towards another point.

  TODO

  This Charm supplements a Thrown attack by the character, causing a
  wafer-thin, convoluted sheet of Elsewhere substance to ripple out from the
  point of impact, disorienting the target as successive parts of it are
  momentarily shifted into the grey realm.  In the case of a successful
  attack--one which hits, even if it does not cause damage--the target must
  roll his (Stamina + Resistance) against the character's (Strength + Thrown).
  If the target fails this check, he is Stunned.

  *[TODO: Is it okay to do this "even if it does not cause damage"?  Does it
  need a keyword so that those whose perfects are in soak can still avoid
  it?  Crippling, maybe?]*
  
  By spending an extra two motes and a point of Willpower, the character can
  attempt to stun all beings within (Essence x 3) yards of the point of
  impact.  Each must resist by making a contested roll as described above.  If
  the target dodged or parried the attack without using a perfect defence,
  they must still attempt to resist if they are within the area of effect.  If
  the Erisian herself is within this radius, she is unaffected.
  
  The character may make this attack without actually throwing his weapon,
  simply by miming an attack with the weapon he wields.  In this case, the
  target will not suffer damage from the attack itself, but is at a -4 penalty
  to his DV, since the only indication of the impact will be a shimmering in
  the air at the last moment.
  
  A second purchase at Essence 4+ keeps the sheet of Elsewhere stable for
  exactly (Thrown + Essence) ticks, and increases its degree of corrugation
  until it provides a form of isolation identical to that produced by
  <<Stealth_sse>>.  This affects a single target, or an area if the additional
  Essence and Willpower is spent.  In the area case, all those affected are
  prevented from targeting not only those outside the are, but also each
  other.  Inventive Erisians have been known to apply this to themselves to
  avoid damage, but it may leave them unable to do much more than Guard or
  Aim--or take preparatory actions such as Shape Sorcery.

  TODO

  This Charm supplements a Thrown action by allowing the character to throw
  himself as if with his weapon.  This allows him to Jump towards his target,
  up to normal range of the weapon, or (Essence x 10) if that is less.  If the
  action is an attack, the character may make an unarmed attack, or one which
  uses weapons which can be wielded at the same time as his current Thrown
  weapon (e.g., a smashfist worn while using a bow).  This attack is treated
  as part of the same attack, using the Thrown attack roll to hit, but the
  other weapon's details to determine damage in Step 7.  If the attack is an
  unarmed one, the character may use it to attempt a grapple, using his Thrown
  rating in place of Martial Arts. This Charm may be used in a flurry, but
  attacks beyond the first in the flurry cannot be grapples.
  
  By spending a point of Willpower the Unhinged can multiply the distance of
  the Jump by his Essence, up to a maximum of (Essence x 20).  If the attack's
  range has been extended by other magics, the storyteller may rule that the
  Jump lasts more than one action.
  
  When using this Charm, the character does not actually throw his weapon, and
  he continues to wield it.  Note also that this Charm need not necessarily be
  used as an attack: it could be used to allow the character to jump up to a
  high balcony, for example.

  TODO
  
  This Charm allows the character to use any objects to hand as effective
  Thrown weapons.  If a suitable stunt can be used to liken it to some real
  weapon type, the character may use the statistics of that weapon, at the
  storyteller's discreation.  The character reduces the normal 3-die Accuracy
  penalty for improvised thrown weapons (<<Exalted>>, p. 127) by her Thrown
  rating, to a minimum of zero.

  Additionally, by spending a point of Willpower, the character can add her
  Essence to her effective (Strength + Athletics) total for the purposes of
  determining the maximum weight of object she can lift, and the range to
  which she can throw it, although not to its base damage.  The character can
  lift and thrown such objects as a single attack, rather than requiring a
  separate miscellaneous action to lift the object before the attack action.
  This use of the Charm is Obvious.  Also, it may be applicable outside
  combat--for example, to rapidly clear rubble from a doorway.

  TODO
  
  The Erisian makes a throwing or stabbing motion his weapon, without actually
  releasing it, and rolls an attack as normal.  The attack causes no damage,
  is unblockable with mundane weapons or armor, applies a -2 external penalty
  to the target's DV due to its invisibilty, and is unaffected by Hardness or
  soak.  Steps 7 and 8 of attack resolution will be irrelevant, unless some
  unusual Reflexive Charm applies.
  
  If the attack achieves even one success, this Charm inflicts a Compulsion on
  the target, to stay pinned to the spot.  Resisting the influence costs two
  Willpower, and will make the target aware of the attempt at unnatural
  influence.
  
  An affected target may turn on the spot, and can act and defect herself as
  usual, provided she does not move to another location.  The target will not
  willingly take so much as a Move action, nor consent to effects which would
  move her.  If moved forcibly, or due to terrain or environmental effects,
  the target will then attempt to stay at her new location.  If remaining in
  place presents a real risk of death, the Compulsion becomes an unacceptable
  order and the effect ends.  The target may end the effect at any point
  during the scene by paying the two Willpower, not only at the point when the
  Compulsion would take hold.
  
  Using this attack does not end any Stealth effects on the character, unless
  the target successfully resists the influence using Willpower at the moment
  of the initial attack.

  *[TODO 2012-08-12 HUGR: Check against <<Archery_pth>>, which costs more but
  works differently.]*

  This Charm supplements a thrown attack, attempting to create an Intimacy
  around in the action in observers.  Provided the attack is successful, the
  character rolls his [(Charisma or Manpiulation) + Thrown] and compares it to
  the MDV of all who witnessed it, including the target.  If the character
  used any effects to enhance his dice pool for the thrown attack, they also
  apply to this roll.  All whose MDV is less than or equal to the successes on
  this roll immediately gain a full-fledged Intimacy of the character's
  choice, as an unnatural Emotion effect.  The subject of the Intimacy must be
  the character, the thrown object, or the target, whereas the tone may be any
  emotion, even if it seems inappropriate to the situation.  Affected beings
  can spend two points of Willpower to shake off this influence at any time
  during the scene when this Charm is invoked.  Thereafter the Intimacy loses
  its magical protection, but likewise affected beings will normally have no
  desire to lose it, as it becomes a natural Intimacy.  Of course, conflicting
  Intimacies, persuasion by others and so on may lead them to work against it.

  This Charm can also be applied in Social situations, by simply taking a
  [(Charisma or Manpiulation) + Thrown] action, without actually making a
  physical attack--throwing down a guantlet in challenge, releasing a dove at
  a ceremony, or tossing a bouquet to an object of the character's desire, for
  instance.  The target in this case is the target of the interaction, not
  necessarily the person or object struck by the thrown item.  Furthermore,
  being Reflexive, this Charm can be used in Combos with Charms from other
  Abilities.
