    unexpected directions etc.

  [Like Archery bbta.  Can be used in a Combo Step 1 to automatically recall
  the weapon after the attack succeeds or fails -- even if the attack itself
  botches.]

  separate Charm as in Archery.]

deps: [ate]

  TODO
  
  [Creates an Illusion of part of the Erisian's presence (shadow, voice,
  creaking floorboards etc.) being some short-ish distance away from where it
  really is, with some variation in details [controllable with a stunt, or
  always just ``subtly different''?].  Must mime an attack toward the target
  point at the start of the Charm, and can't move it thereafter, though she
  may move herself.  Effect a bit like Solar's Observer-Deceiving Attack makes
  observers roll to guess right between the target location and the Exalt's
  real location, if she attacks, or takes other actions dependent on her
  location, such as attempting to lure/persuade people towards/away from her
  fake location.  Note, however, that that Charm is Instant, so this one can't
  be as good.]

  TODO
  
  [Allows character to throw himself like a net, as a grapple attack.  Can use
  Thrown in place of Martial Arts for initial attack.  Can attack with some
  small range -- Jump distance?  Some kind of bonus?  Bonus if immediately
  [and/or?] eventually choosing to Break Hold by throwing the opponent away?
  Maybe, if attack fails, character isn't automatically grappled himself
  ... but is Knockback'ed???]

--- !Charm
id: bpp
name: "Butterfly Pinion Pitch"
cost: 6m
mins: {Thrown: 3, Essence: 2}
type: [Supplemental]
keys: [Combo-OK, Compulsion]
dur: One scene
deps: [itw]
text: |

  TODO
  
  The Erisian makes a throwing or stabbing motion his weapon, without actually
  releasing it, and rolls an attack as normal.  The attack causes no damage,
  is unblockable with mundane weapons or armor, applies a -2 external penalty
  to the target's DV due to its invisibilty, and is unaffected by Hardness or
  soak.  Steps 7 and 8 of attack resolution will be irrelevant, unless some
  unusual Reflexive Charm applies.
  
  If the attack achieves even one success, this Charm inflicts a Compulsion on
  the target, to stay pinned to the spot.  Resisting the influence costs two
  Willpower, and will make the target aware of the attempt at unnatural
  influence.
  
  An affected target may turn on the spot, and can act and defect herself as
  usual, provided she does not move to another location.  The target will not
  willingly take so much as a Move action, nor consent to effects which would
  move her.  If moved forcibly, or due to terrain or environmental effects,
  the target will then attempt to stay at her new location.  If remaining in
  place presents a real risk of death, the Compulsion becomes an unacceptable
  order and the effect ends.  The target may end the effect at any point
  during the scene by paying the two Willpower, not only at the point when the
  Compulsion would take hold.
  
  Using this attack does not end any Stealth effects on the character, unless
  the target successfully resists the influence using Willpower at the moment
  of the initial attack.

  TODO
  
  [Creates a new Intimacy, toward a thrown object or toward the person or
  object which it hits.  Affects all who witness the attack, except for the
  Erisian and the target itself.  Can spend [X] Willpower to resist.  Intimacy
  appears at full strength and lasts [one day?  one scene?] [and magically
  resists removal?] by default.  Thereafter it fades at one point per [day?],
  unless an affected being spends at least one scene acting in a way which
  reinforces the intimacy, in which case it stabilises.  This Charm does not
  magically reinforce the intimacy after the first [scene/day], so it may be
  removed as normal.]
