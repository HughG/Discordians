  point at the start of the Charm, and can't move it thereafter, though she
  may move herself.  Effect a bit like Solar's Observer-Deceiving Attack makes
  observers roll to guess right between the target location and the Exalt's
  real location, if she attacks, or takes other actions dependent on her
  location, such as attempting to lure/persuade people towards/away from her
  fake location.  Note, however, that that Charm is Instant, so this one can't

  TODO

  This Charm supplements a Thrown attack by the character, causing a
  wafer-thin, convoluted sheet of Elsewhere substance to ripple out from the
  point of impact, disorienting the target as successive parts of it are
  momentarily shifted into the grey realm.  In the case of a successful
  attack--one which hits, even if it does not cause damage--the target must
  roll his (Stamina + Resistance) against the character's (Strength + Thrown).
  If the target fails this check, he is Stunned.
  
  By spending an extra two motes and a point of Willpower, the character can
  attempt to stun all beings within (Essence x 3) yards of the point of
  impact.  Each must resist by making a contested roll as described above.  If
  the target dodged or parried the attack without using a perfect defence,
  they must still attempt to resist if they are within the area of effect.  If
  the Erisian herself is within this radius, she is unaffected.
  
  The character may make this attack without actually throwing his weapon,
  simply by miming an attack with the weapon he wields.  In this case, the
  target will not suffer damage from the attack itself, but is at a -4 penalty
  to his DV, since the only indication of the impact will be a shimmering in
  the air at the last moment.
  
  A second purchase at Essence 4+ keeps the sheet of Elsewhere stable for
  exactly (Thrown + Essence) ticks, and increases its degree of corrugation
  until it provides a form of isolation identical to that produced by
  <<Stealth_sse>>.  This affects a single target, or an area if the additional
  Essence and Willpower is spent.  In the area case, all those affected are
  prevented from targeting not only those outside the are, but also each
  other.  Inventive Erisians have been known to apply this to themselves to
  avoid damage, but it may leave them unable to do much more than Guard or
  Aim--or take preparatory actions such as Shape Sorcery.

  TODO

  This Charm supplements a Thrown action by allowing the character to throw
  himself as if with his weapon.  This allows him to Jump towards his target,
  up to normal range of the weapon, or (Essence x 10) if that is less.  If the
  action is an attack, the character may make an unarmed attack, or one which
  uses weapons which can be wielded at the same time as his current Thrown
  weapon (e.g., a smashfist worn while using a bow).  This attack is treated
  as part of the same attack, using the Thrown attack roll to hit, but the
  other weapon's details to determine damage in Step 7.  If the attack is an
  unarmed one, the character may use it to attempt a grapple, using his Thrown
  rating in place of Martial Arts. This Charm may be used in a flurry, but
  attacks beyond the first in the flurry cannot be grapples.
  
  By spending a point of Willpower the Unhinged can multiply the distance of
  the Jump by his Essence, up to a maximum of (Essence x 20).  If the attack's
  range has been extended by other magics, the storyteller may rule that the
  Jump lasts more than one action.
  
  When using this Charm, the character does not actually throw his weapon, and
  he continues to wield it.  Note also that this Charm need not necessarily be
  used as an attack: it could be used to allow the character to jump up to a
  high balcony, for example.

  TODO
  
  The Erisian makes a throwing or stabbing motion his weapon, without actually
  releasing it, and rolls an attack as normal.  The attack causes no damage,
  is unblockable with mundane weapons or armor, applies a -2 external penalty
  to the target's DV due to its invisibilty, and is unaffected by Hardness or
  soak.  Steps 7 and 8 of attack resolution will be irrelevant, unless some
  unusual Reflexive Charm applies.
  
  If the attack achieves even one success, this Charm inflicts a Compulsion on
  the target, to stay pinned to the spot.  Resisting the influence costs two
  Willpower, and will make the target aware of the attempt at unnatural
  influence.
  
  An affected target may turn on the spot, and can act and defect herself as
  usual, provided she does not move to another location.  The target will not
  willingly take so much as a Move action, nor consent to effects which would
  move her.  If moved forcibly, or due to terrain or environmental effects,
  the target will then attempt to stay at her new location.  If remaining in
  place presents a real risk of death, the Compulsion becomes an unacceptable
  order and the effect ends.  The target may end the effect at any point
  during the scene by paying the two Willpower, not only at the point when the
  Compulsion would take hold.
  
  Using this attack does not end any Stealth effects on the character, unless
  the target successfully resists the influence using Willpower at the moment
  of the initial attack.
