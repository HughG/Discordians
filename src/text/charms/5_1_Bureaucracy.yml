  TODO
  
  This Charm gives the character a clear understanding of an organization with
  which she is interacting, providing knowledge of all departments and
  factions within an organization, official and unofficial, and identifying
  the true leaders of each.  For each faction or leader attempting to remain
  unknown, the character must make a successful ([Perception or Intelligence]
  + Bureaucracy) roll.  The difficulty is 1 but the roll is subject to an
  external penalty, determined by the Storyteller on the basis of how much
  effort the targets are putting into concealment--typically ([Manipulation +
  Socialize + Magnitude] รท 2).  Information on the leaders' identities is
  retained permanently, though leadership may change later.  The maximum
  Magnitude of organization which can be read is equal to the character's
  (Essence + Bureaucracy).  For larger entities, the character will receive
  infomation about a subset of groups and factions up to that size.  The
  Storyteller is the final arbiter of what information is available.

  Furthermore, for the rest of the scene, any external penalties on actions
  related to influencing a faction, or relationships between factions, are
  reduced.  The reduction is equal to the lower of (her Bureaucracy rating)
  and (the Magnitude of those present who belong to the relevant factions).
  
  At Essence 3+ the character can apply this Charm to a group which she can
  perceive, without having to interact with them or even reveal her presence,
  though she must observe them for a scene first to do so.  At Essence 4+ the
  Magnitude of those present no longer limits the reduction in external
  penalties: she can obtain her full (Bureaucracy) rating in reduction on the
  basis of interacting with or observing even a single individual.

  TODO

  This Charm allows the character to temporily take the advantages of certain
  Backgrounds related to groups and apply them to other connected groups.  The
  relevant Backgrounds are Abyssal Command, Backing, Command, Contacts, Cult,
  Followers, Henchmen, Influence, and Spies, or any other set which the
  Storyteller deems apprpriate.

  Initially, the character can only apply this to benefit from association
  with groups which are wholly contained within groups for which he already
  has one or more dots of the relevant Background.  The character need only
  know of the existence of such sub-groups, not the details of their make-up
  or operations.  The magic of the Charm provides the necessary information to
  be identified as an acceptable contact for the group.

  At Bureaucracy 3+, the character can insinuate his way into a related group,
  even if it only partially overlaps with one he already has a connection
  to--it need not be a strict sub-group.

  At Essence 3+ the character can, at the end of the scene, spend experience
  points to permanently shift her association.  One or more dots of the
  original Background, associated with a single group, can be converted to
  relate to the chosen new group, at a cost of 1xp per dot.  Alternatively,
  new dots in that Background can be bought for the new group, leaving the
  original association intact, at a cost of 2xp per dot.

  At Essence 4+ the character can also use his association with this new group
  to buy dots in different Backgrounds related to the group: Allies, Artifact,
  Class, Echoes, Familiar, Infamy, Liege, Manse, Mentor, Resources, Sufi,
  Underworld Manse, and Whispers.  The Storyteller will probably require
  additional justification for some of these.  Furthermore, posessing dots in
  some of these Backgrounds without also having wider, related backing of some
  sort is liable to lead the character into some tricky situations.
  
  At the end of the scene, unless the character spends experience to gain
  permanent membership, the reaction of other group members is up to the
  Storyteller.  They may or may not immediately see the character as an
  interloper.  It is possible, though somewhat expensive, to reactivate the
  Charm at the start of each new scene to provide continuous cover.

  *[TODO: more fluff]* With knowledge of the overt and covert roles and
  communication channels in an organization, the Exalt is able to arrange for
  her own pet project to be achieved without drawing attention to it.

  Activating this Charm causes some subset of an organization to carry out a
  project without mentioning it to anyone beyond the group or otherwise
  drawing attention to it, beleiving that it is meant to be kept secret for
  reasons of discretion, illegality, or simply because it's a surprise for
  someone's birthday.  The character may choose a reason or allow the group to
  invent its own.  The group's Leader must spend 3 point of Loyalty to resist
  this effect, which may be spent when the Charm is activated or cumulatively
  later.  Outsiders will not notice the work without actively investigating
  the group to uncover it, and such attempts suffer an external penalty equal
  to the character's Essence.  The maximum Magnitude of group which can be
  affected is equal to the character's (Essence + 1), and the maximum scale of
  concealed undertaking is one that could be carried out by a group 2 steps
  smaller in Magnitude.  The minimum effective Magnitude for the undertaking
  is zero, and this Charm is inapplicable to groups of less than Magnitude 2.

  The Charm ends when the character releases her commitment of motes, or when
  the project is either successfully completed or completely derailed.
  Affected members of the organization will continue to believe that the
  project is to be kept secret, but their belief is no longer magically
  enforced, so they may be persuaded otherwise without the Leader spending
  Loyalty points.

  *[TODO: This Charm, especially, needs to say how it works in the CRM.]*

  Whereas some would improve the efficiency of an organization by directly
  reshaping it, the Discordian knows that the same ends can often be achieved
  simply by gently adjusting the goals of the individuals within it.  The
  Exalt subtly influences the organization so that, despite still following
  selfish internal goals, its various parts effectively work much more
  successfully towards an overall aim.  The Charm supplements a dramatic
  action, adding the character's subtle guidance and suggestion to a project.
  He must be involved in its execution, but need not lead the action, nor even
  be a member of the group.  It reduces internal penaltes on the action by the
  group's Magnitude.  If the character's involvement is not obvious to most of
  the group, and the action succeeds, then the group puts this success down in
  large part to the particular way they worked, thereby permanently reducing
  internal penalties by one point, as a mysterious air of good feeling
  persists after the project.  The total permanent reduction in penalties for
  a given group over repeated application of this Charm, by any number of
  Discordians, cannot exceed the Exalt's Essence, although the temporary
  improvement may.

  Eclipse-caste Solars bind others, not always willing, in oaths of servitude
  enforced by the might of Heaven.  The Unbending Arm, however, recognises
  that oaths are more likely to remain unbroken if they are fairly made, and
  they can seal a bargain with the unbalanced balance of the power of Eris.
  This Charm allows a Discordian to magically reinforce an oath between two
  individuals or groups, provided each side swears freely.  The character may
  be one of those affected, but need not be.  Unwilling parties are not valid
  targets for this Charm, nor are those whose willingness comes only through
  threats, unnatural mental influence, or breaking of Motivation.  This is
  true regardless of the source of the influence, or whether or not it was
  specifically intended to persuade the target into accepting an oath.
  
  Assuming both parties willingly swear to their side of the bargain, the
  magic of the Charm ensures that the first party to break the oath will
  suffer a single occurrence of terrible misfortune, similar to the
  Eclipse-caste anima ability.  At the same time, all beings bound by the oath
  (and the character, even if he is not one of the parties) will know that the
  it was broken, and by whom.  If the wronged party subsequently takes steps
  to gain redress, they will benefit from a perfect success on one action in
  pursuit of that goal, at a highly opportune moment.  An oath-breaker can be
  punished only once by a single invocation of this Charm.
  
  Without the power of Yu-Shan behind it, given that Eris generally leaves
  folk to work things out for themselves, this binding lasts only until the
  Exalt dies.  Both parties will know if this happens, and can distinguish it
  from a breaking of the oath.  Eliciting an oath of truce from some enemy may
  therefore not be particularly useful, but a fair trade may fend off
  violence, at least until both sides have done their part.  There are no
  ancient pacts to protect any Division of Discordians as they wander the
  worlds, but most intelligent beings can be bargained with, if the price is
  right.

  The Bishops of Greyface enjoy spreading confusion, particularly around the
  fundamental issue, for an organization, of exactly what it is supposed to be
  doing.  Employing this charm, the player rolls ([Charisma or Manipulation] +
  Bureaucracy + Essence) with a difficulty equal to the leader's MDV.  If
  successful, the organization forgets its Motivation; it will not act against
  it (unless otherwise compelled) but neither will it act in support of it,
  with the leader likely to spend Loyalty points to resist external attempts
  to persuade the organization to do so.  The leader may also spend Loyalty to
  resist or shake off this Illusion, however.  Spending one point lifts it for
  a single scene, and spending a cumulative total of four ends the effect.
  The maximum Magnitude of group which can be affected is equal to the
  character's (Essence + 1).
  
  An organization affected by this Illusion is not completely paralysed.  It
  will still carry on minor day-to-day activities, giving the surface
  appearance of being functional.  It may also successfully carry out
  activities not related to its main Motivation.  Applying this Charm to small
  outposts of the Immaculate Order can be particularly amusing.
  
  At Essence 3+, the character may choose to apply this amnesia more
  selectively, masking an individual Policy, or suspending effective action on
  one chosen Project.

  The sometimes crazed notions of the Unbending Arm are nonetheless unusually
  compelling.  Using this Charm, the character adds a new Intimacy to an
  organization's Policy, by manipulating its circumstances.  It supplements a
  Bureacracy action which affects some aspect of the group or a society within
  which it operates, adding (Essence) dice to the roll, and applying unnatural
  mental influence to impose a new Intimacy as a Compulsion effect.  The
  action must either target the group but may do so indirectly, for example,
  by manipulating prices or laws which affect the group.  The action also need
  not apparently relate to the new Intimacy in any way.  For example, simply
  buying goods or services from the group would be sufficient.  The maximum
  Magnitude of group which can be affected is equal to the character's
  (Essence + 1).
  
  Either side may apply a bonus to MDV due to relative Magnitude, as normal.
  If the character's successes exceed the leader's MDV (regardless of the
  person or persons addressed), the target group takes on the mission as a new
  Intimacy, to be pursued to the best of its ability.  The change takes effect
  over the course of the month after the character makes her trades, bribes
  officials to change laws or whatever her action was.  At Essence 4 this is
  reduced to a week, and at Essence 5 to one day.  Only after this point does
  the desired new Policy affect the group.  Thereafter the policy persists
  unless and until the group's leader spends a cumulative total of eight
  points of Loyalty to shake off the effect.  Any groups of Magnitude 1 or
  more which split off from the main group, any time after the Charm is
  activated, must separately spend Loyalty points to counter the effect.
  
  Mundane attempts to discern the source of the effect automatically fail, and
  those supplemented by magic are subject to an external penalty equal to the
  character's Essence.  These limits apply equally to attempts made when the
  Charm is activated, and those after the fact.

  Some days the course of the Holy Chao is a subtle dance, and on others it
  barges straight through.  When the plans of the Chosen of Eris cannot wait,
  they take the reins themselves.  This Charm enhances <<Bureaucracy_bpp>>,
  allowing the character to optionally exert an immediate and more powerful
  effect, as a Servitude effect rather than the Compulsion of its
  prerequisite, at the cost of a loss of subtlety.  The action this Charm
  enhances must be one which directly states a new Motivation to govern the
  Policy of an organization.  The character cannot take some more subtle
  action to communicate this idea.  However, he need not address the leader in
  person, so long as he speaks or writes to at least one member of the
  organization, nor need he speak from a position of official authority.  This
  directness means that, in contrast to its prerequisite, this Charm does not
  automatically defeat or impose penalties on attempts to identify the source
  of the effect.
  
  If the roll succeeds, the leader must spend four points of Loyalty if she
  wishes to resist the Charm's effect when it is activated.  If Charm takes
  effect but the mission is in conflict with the group's Motivation, it loses
  a dot of Magnitude, and those lost immediately form a splinter group with
  the mission as their Motivation.  If the new goal is in line with the
  organization's original Motivation, then they will drop all other activities
  to pursue it for the first (Essence) days, throwing financial and political
  caution to the winds (although not ignoring the need to eat and sleep --
  work/life balance is important, y'know).

  Confusion can be a gift, in the right hands; though, as ever, it is better
  to give than to receive.  This Charm can be used in social, bureaucratic or
  mass combat situations, against some organised unit.  It disrupts lines of
  communication and supply to make it harder for a target unit to achieve its
  goals.  The effects employed are extremely subtle, causing any mundane
  attempts to discover the source of the problem to fail automatically, and
  applying an external penalty of (character's permanent Essence) to any
  magically-assisted attempts.  The maximum Magnitude of group which can be
  affected is equal to the character's (Essence + 1).
  
  For social units, vital phrases are misunderstood, the right people can't be
  found, and important tasks are forgotten briefly.  Together, these amount to
  a -4 external penalty applied to any attempts to get the group to work in an
  organised way in support of its Motivation or any of its Policies, for the
  next 25 hours.  After that, the penalty reduces by 1 each day until it
  returns to normal, or until the Leader spends a point of Loyalty to reassert
  control, in which case penalties vanish immediately.
  
  Applied to a bureaucratic organization it is even more effective, in a
  narrower way.  In relation to a chosen project, memos are lost, official
  seals break, key staff members fall ill and so on.  All this imposes a -4
  external penalty to all its actions for the day and, once the scene has
  ended, the consequent confusion delays the project by (character's
  [Bureacuracy x Essence]) days.  A cumulative expenditure of (character's
  Bureacuracy) points of Loyalty by the leader can bring the project back on
  track sooner.
  
  In a battle it is less effective, but still useful in the right situation.
  It will cause a target unit to act as if it had 2 fewer Relays than it
  actually does (often provoking communications failure, leading to a -2 Drill
  penalty), and will remove 2 points of bonuses to Might (though not reducing
  the group's inherent Might rating), as supplies are lost, ammunition is
  delivered to the wrong units, and maintenance orders for Magitech are
  misdirected, causing them to work poorly, if at all.  These penalties vanish
  the next day.

  Too often, those who serve a larger cause get caught up in that service and
  give it more credence than they give themselves, which is something to be
  taken advantage of.  This Charm causes an organistion to lose all record of
  a particular fact, or introduces a new ``fact'' into their archives and
  common understanding.  It must be activated in the presence of a member of
  the organization, or in one of its offices, permanent or temporary.  The
  organization must have a Magnitude of no more than the character's (Essence
  + Bureaucracy).  The datum added or removed must be about something external
  to the organization; so, for example, an Erisian cannot make himself the new
  leader of the Immaculate Order.
  
  The effect can be resisted as unnatural mental influence, at a cost of one
  Loyalty point per scene, and it is removed entirely once the Leader has spent
  a cumulative total of four points.
  
  Note that there is nothing preventing the organization from subsequently
  correcting its observations and updating its records.  However, in the short
  term, this Charm can be remarkably useful for such tasks as escaping from
  the attentions of the Wyld Hunt.  Also, for information which is truly hard
  to discover, the organization may never be able to re-learn the truth.

  A word in the right butterfly-like ear can have unexpected effects far away.
  This Charm supplements an attempt by the character to manipulate a single
  in-process decision within an organization.  Its target is any single member
  of the organization, no matter how lowly: the magic of the Charm will work
  its way toward the real decision-maker (who may or may not be the one
  officially in that role).
  
  The character makes a contested ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Bureaucracy)
  roll against the target's (Intelligence + [Integrity or Bureaucracy]).  If
  it is directly in opposition to the group's Motivation, and the group's
  Magnitude exceeds the Exalt's Essence, the attempt automatically fails.
  Mere Policies (Intimacies) do not afford this protection, however.  If
  successful, the decision will go the way the character desires, unless the
  Leader spends three points of Loyalty immediately.  As with
  <<Bureaucracy_rcm>>, there is nothing to prevent the organization from
  changing the decision later, depending on its Motivation and tendencies --
  unless, of course, it's too late.  The decision will not be changed back for
  at least (character's Essence) days, however, without further magical
  intervention.
  
  This Charm is only effective upon decisions which the organization was
  already intending to make, and has not yet settled.  It cannot force a group
  to decide to do something which had never crossed its collective mind, nor
  to revisit a decision already made.

  Trying to maintain control of a large organization is a wearing task, which
  is why the Children of Eris prefer to just jump to the top of the heap
  temporarily.  With this Charm, the hand of Authority takes control of an
  organization for one scene.  The original Leader is supplanted and all
  members of the group will recognise that the character is now the woman in
  charge, unless they spend three points of Willpower to resist the effect.
  The Charm affects all those present when it is activated, and all who enter
  the character's presence during the scene.
  
  Those affected are not blindly compelled to obey orders, but will generally
  accept any directions which do not directly contradict the Motivation of the
  group, for example, unless they have strong personal reasons not to.  Anyone
  ordered to carry instructions to unaffected group members elsewhere receives
  a bonus of (the character's Essence) in automatic successes on all rolls
  directly related to persuading them to understand and follow those
  instructions.  Once the effect ends, all will be fully aware of what they
  have just done, although they probably won't understand why.
  
  It is possible, though expensive, to re-invoke this Charm at the start of
  each new scene, to prolong the character's turn at the helm.  However, if
  the character attempts to use this Charm on a group more than once, in the
  immediately following scene or at any later time, any individuals who
  directly interacted with her on previous occasions may resist the effect at
  a reduced cost of two Willpower points the first time, and one Willpower
  thereafter.

  TODO
  
  This Charm allows the Overseer to monitor the workings of the systems in
  which he is entwined.  Activating the Charm, he selects a particular Policy,
  Project or official (effectively, anyone with at least Backing 1) of any
  organization of which he is a member.  For the duration, he becomes
  instantly aware if something occurs within the organization, or in its
  interactions with the rest of the world, which significantly relates to the
  topic which he has chosen to monitor.  He will know whether the influence of
  the event is positive, negative, or as yet unclear, and he will know where
  it happened (both physically, and in terms of the organization's structure).
  However, he senses nothing through this Charm's effect until it impinges on
  the organization.  Thus, planned bribery, proposed changes in the law,
  conspiracies to assassinate key members and so on will be undetected until
  they happen (unless this scheming goes on within the organization, of
  course).  Even a spy joining the ranks would not attract his attention,
  until she did something which related to a monitored topic, such as gaining
  unauthorized access to confidential documents.
  
  This Charm can be concurrently activated to cover multiple topics within one
  group, or aspects of multiple organizations.  At Essence 4, the character
  need only activate it once per organization, being automatically aware of
  events which affect any significant Project, aspect of Policy, or relatively
  senior official.  He may further designate interest in up to (Essence)
  additional topics of the same sort, which might otherwise seem
  insignificant.  A second purchase at Essence 4 allows the character to
  activate the Charm to monitor all significant aspects of the affairs of any
  organization with which he has interacted in the last month.  He need not be
  a member of the group, but this Charm does not reveal the Policies, Projects
  or officials of organization to him.  Therefore he will only be made aware
  of impacts on those topics that he already knows or later learns about.
  Paying the Charm's additional cost to extend his senses and monitor events
  is a valid way to learn about new topics, of course.
  
  There is no limit on the size of organization which the character may
  monitor in this way but, for large organizations, there may be so many
  interactions affecting it that it will be hard to pick out interesting
  events through general monitoring.  Observing specific topics is likely to
  be more fruitful in such cases.
