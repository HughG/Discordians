  Wise men have often said that genius and madness are linked, but only the
  Chosen of Eris have found a way to turn their madness into genius.  This
  Charm allows the Exalt to add the lower of her Hodge and Podge ratings to
  her Dodge MDV and Parry MDV against one attack.

  Some have said that the Erisian Exalted live in a world of their own; the
  truth is that this can be an advantage.  This Charm allows the user to seek
  the refuge of daydreams to sidestep attempts to pull her away from that
  which is important to her.  It can be invoked in response to any attack
  which would lower Virtues or Willpower, or against mental influence which
  would destroy or weaken Intimacies, or cause her to act against her
  Intimacies or Motivation.
  
  In the case of natural mental influence, this Charm automatically defeats
  it.  For unnatural mental influence the contest is between the character's
  (Essence + Integrity) and the (Essence + Ability) of the Charm used, or the
  caster's (Essence + Occult) for spells.  In either case, if she fails the
  roll she may still spend Willpower to resist the effect, if applicable.  If
  she botches the roll, she is automatically affected and for the rest of the
  scene cannot spend Willpower to resist that one effect.
  
  Similarly, if some effect threatens to directly lower any of the character's
  Virtues or her Willpower, temporarily or permanently, she may make the same
  contested roll to avoid the effect.  Furthermore, if one of the Fair Folk
  attempts to feed on the character she may use this Charm to fool her
  attacker, even if she is willing or influenced to accept the raksha's
  feeding.  The normal Virtue roll to feed is contested against the victim's
  own (Essence + Integrity).  The latter successes are subtracted from those
  for the Virtue roll, reducing the damage the feeder does.  If the Virtue
  successes are outnumbered by those from the (Essence + Integrity) roll, then
  the Fair One believes themselves to have bled off that many dots of
  Willpower or Virtue and will account their Essence accordingly, meaning that
  they may be surprised to find it run out sooner than they expected.
  
  In any case, if the character succeeds against the attack, she will gain a
  clear sense of what influence the attacker intended, should she wish to play
  out her supposedly altered state.

  To attempt to twist the minds of those who make up the Unbending Arm is
  foolish indeed.  This Charm allows the character to perfectly defend against
  any form of natural or unnatural mental influence which would otherwise
  bypass his defenses.  He will gain a vague impression of the intended
  influence, but not the details.  Furthermore, as a counterattack, the
  originator of the effect will herself be subjected to an Illusion causing
  her to believe that her attack was successful.  The Illusion lasts as long
  as the original effect would have, and may be resisted on the same terms as
  the original effect.

  They Who Carve Truth In Stone are able to form that metaphorical stone from
  the gossamer of daydreams, convincing herself that her view of the world is
  the only right one, if only for a short while.  This Charm perfectly defends
  against any Compulsion, Emotion, Illusion and Servitude attacks for the rest
  of the scene, plus the mental and emotional aspects of any Shaping attacks.
  Additionally, any compulsions due to lack of Willpower, or an overflowing of
  Hodge or Podge, are delayed until the end of the scene.  On the other hand,
  any attempts by the character to act against her Virtues, Intimacies or
  Motivation have their difficulties increased by 2.  Use of this Charm gains
  the character a point of Podge but, if that takes the count over 10, the
  consequences are still delayed until the end of the scene.

  TODO
  
  Whenever the character is subject to hostile unnatural mental influence and
  could pay Willpower to resist it (that is, she has sufficient temporary
  Willpower), she may instead choose to submit to it and pay a single point of
  Willpower to reduce her Podge rating by one point, to a minimum of zero.
  She may be prevented from acquiescing by other effects.  Influence is deemed
  hostile if the character believes that there is at least a good chance that
  acquiescing to it will be harmful to her values, goals or interests.  A
  character cannot apply this Charm's effect to beneficial or neutral mental
  influence.
  
  The cost is always 1 Willpower and the reduction one point of Podge,
  regardless of how many points of Willpower would be required to resist the
  effect.  If the effect allows the character later opportunities to resist,
  she may do so without losing the benefit of this Charm.  However, she cannot
  apply this Charm's effect more than once for each activation of an effect
  against her.

  TODO
  
  Each purchase of this Charm permanently enhances the character by giving her
  increasing her maximum temporary Willpower by 1 point.  This additional pool
  of Willpower is initially empty and will not be refilled by Conviction rolls
  each morning.  Instead it is filled by any other effect such as stunts and
  Charms, and this extra pool will be filled before her normal Willpower pool.
  This Charm may be purchased up to (Essence) times.
  
  At Essence 3+, this Charm has a further use in times of dire need.  The
  desperate Discordian may reflexively disable one purchase of this Charm to
  immediately refill her Willpower pool completely, including any points
  available from remaining purchases of this Charm.  The size of the pool is
  calculated without the point added by the disabled purchase, so will be one
  dot smaller.  The Charm becomes available again after 23 days.  Disabling
  the last purchase of this Charm in this way prevents the character from
  using any Charms which have it as a prerequisite, directly or indirectly,
  until it re-activates (or she purchases it again).

  TODO
  
  This Charm allows the Unbending Arm to transfer Willpower between himself
  and another being.  The character may transfer a number of points up to his
  permanent Essence, in either direction, at a cost of 4 motes per point.  If
  the target does not have a Willpower pool, the Charm is inapplicable and no
  motes are spent.
  
  If the other being is unwilling, the character must make a successful attack
  to touch it, and the two make a contested (Essence + Integrity) roll.  If
  the Erisian wins, the transfer is in the desired direction, and he gains a
  point of Podge.  If he fails, the direction is reversed, and he gains a
  point of Hodge.  In the case of a tie, nothing happens, but the motes are
  spent.  Used on a willing target, there is no contested roll and no gain of
  Hodge or Podge.
  
  In any case, this Charm cannot reduce either being's temporary Willpower
  rating below zero, nor increase it beyond its maximum.

  TODO
  
  This Charm allows the priests of Eris to extend their unique viewpoints to
  the very Virtues which make up the fabric of mortal souls.  The character
  can purchase the Charm no more than (Integrity) times and no more than once
  per Virtue.  Each gives the character 3 dots of Virtue Specialty, with the
  breadth and suitability of such Specialties subject to Storyteller approval.
  For example, a Stone-Carver might take a Compassion Specialty in ``acting
  for the greater good'', or ``winning new friends'', or a Valor Specialty of
  ``in battle against greater numbers'', or ``reckless bravery''.

  These dots provide both extra Virtue channels, and extra dice when
  channelling a Virtue, where the Specialty is applicable.  They may stretch
  the meaning of the Virtue quite far: at Essence 4+, if a character wishes to
  suppress a Virtue, and has dots of Specialty in that Virtue which actually
  support suppressing the basic Virtue, she may roll those specialty dice
  separately and subtract them from the successes from the base roll, giving a
  minimum result of zero successes.  For example, consider a character with
  four dots in Compassion, and two dots of Compassion Specialty in ``acting
  for the greater good''.  Faced with the need to sacrifice a small number of
  innocents to save a larger population, she would roll four dice for her
  basic Virtue, then separately roll two dice for her Specialty, and subtract
  the successes of the latter roll from those of the former.

  TODO
  
  This Charm allows an agent of the Authority to instantly forge an additional
  Intimacy on a certain theme, which is treated as an additional Motivation,
  with all the benefits and drawbacks thereof.  There is nothing to prevent
  the character from holding conflicting Intimacies and Motivations within
  herself, both natural and created by this Charm.  The character may maintain
  a number of such additional Intimacies equal to her Conviction.
  
  Furthermore, she is able to spend Willpower to channel her base, unmodified
  Integrity, as if it were an equivalently-rated Virtue, in support of these
  Intimacies.  The available channels of Integrity in each story are shared
  among all these Intimacies.  Using this Charm to maintain three Intimacies
  does not gain (Integrity x 3) opportunities to channel Integrity, only
  (Integrity).
  
  This Charm comes in two variants, though it is possible that some Erisians
  have invented further variants.  The initial purchase of the Charm includes
  one of these, and the other may be purchased for half the normal cost of the
  Charm.
  
  _Policy-Molding Arrogation_: This variant supports Intimacies related to the
  Policy of a social group.  They must involve supporting, opposing or
  changing in some particular way the Policy of that group.
  
  _Moot Point Focus_: This variant covers Intimacies related to holding a
  specific opinion on some matter which is open to question.  For example, the
  character could choose to believe that slavery is beneficial to slaves or
  that demons are essentially good, but not that there is no price attached to
  a slave or that demons are not generally bound in Malfeas.  Grey areas exist
  here, certainly; for example, the Storyteller might allow the character to
  believe that slaves have no masters other than themselves, since slaves are
  usually free to attempt to live that way, though it may cause them some
  trouble.

  TODO
  
  This Charm enhances the Discordian's power of self-determination, allowing
  her to share it with others.  It is activated in connection with an
  organization or social group about which the character holds an Intimacy.
  When a social attack is made against the group, the character can respond as
  if the attack had been made against her.  She will become instantly aware of
  any such attack to which she could so respond, no matter where she is, and
  need not be present to respond.  Activating Charms in response to the attack
  adds a surcharge of 2 motes.  If several Charms are used in a Combo, the
  surcharge is still paid only once.
