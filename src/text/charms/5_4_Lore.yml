  The Children of Chaos are not really as all-knowing as they would sometimes
  like others to think, but they have surprising sources of information.  This
  Charm enhances a roll involving the Lore Ability by allowing the character
  to draw on the knowledge held in the environment and society around her.
  The subject of the roll must be something about the character's physical
  surroundings, or something which is recorded in nearby books, memory
  crystals etc., or something generally known by people nearby.  The range
  depends on the character's Essence rating: at Essence 2, it is 100 yards; at
  3, 1 mile; at 4, 10 miles, and so on, to a maximum of 1000 miles at Essence
  6.  The information sought must be something generally known or specifically
  recorded, so this Charm tends not to be of use in, for example,
  investigating crime scenes.
  
  The effect of the Charm differs depending on whether or not the subject is
  something the character would reasonably be expected to know.  If not, this
  Charm allows the character to make a normal Lore roll, as if it were in fact
  within the character's experience.  If it is something the character might
  already know, this Charm reduces the difficulty by at least 1, and possibly
  by more at Storyteller discretion, to a minimum of zero.
  
  The character does not need to speak or read any languages in which the
  information is recorded, nor actually find a partcular book or person to
  consult.  This means that, for example, one of the Authority can enhance her
  chances of success in operating an ancient artifact simply by standing
  briefly in the middle of a relevant First Age library, perhaps reducing the
  difficulty by three or four, depending on the relevance of the content.
  Using the same library to learn about the Shogunate would reduce difficulty
  by one or two points at most, since the Dragon-Blooded sealed off access to
  such facilities.  It would be unlikely to be of any help in learning about
  current affairs in the Age of Sorrows.  Bear in mind that, even in halls of
  gathered lore, things which are generally known may not be correct.

  TODO
  
  This Charm allows the character to make a Lore roll on topics which are
  known, but not widely, in a given area.  The subject must be one about which
  the character could not otherwise validly make a Lore roll.  Such facts and
  figures may be actively-kept secrets, obscure trivia in libraries, or simply
  humdrum details of interest to few.  The information need not be written
  down, but it must be known, even instinctively, by a number beings of at
  least Magnitude 2, and of at least animal intelligence.
  
  The range follows the character's Essence rating as with Holographic Memory
  Modus.  The character need not share a common language with the beings which
  hold the desired information but, if not, it may be communicated less
  clearly, particularly if it comes from an animal-level intelligence.
  Knowledge sought may include hypotheses, opinions, and other such uncertain
  ``knowledge''.  If different information is available from separate groups,
  the character will gain insight from only the smallest of them, or one
  chosen by the Storyteller if there are several of equivalent Magnitude.  As
  with its precursor, information from this Charm will accurately represent
  knowledge from nearby beings, but their knowledge may not be correct.

  The Priests of Discord change names almost as often as they change hats, and
  most often the true name of something really doesn't matter at all.  But
  there are times when it can be a distinct advantage to know with whom one is
  dealing.
  
  This Charm reveals the true name of the target, regardless of any disguises,
  Shaping, Fate effects or other concealments.  In the case of a roll-off, the
  character gains (Essence) extra successes.  It does not guarantee that the
  character can pronounce or write down that name, if they do not speak the
  langauge.  However, they will know the name if they encounter it again.  If
  the being has no true name, for example, in the case of a Deathlord, the
  character will learn that.
  
  If the target has ancestors who are anything other than extras, this Charm
  will additionally reveal those on the single most powerful lineage, going
  back (character's Essence) generations.

  TODO
  
  This Charm allows the character to temporarily redirect someone's focus,
  adding up to (Essence) points of new Specialties across up to (Essence)
  traits.  The character can add at most three dots to each trait.  These dots
  do not count towards the usual three-dot limit on Specialties.  Dots can be
  added for a new Specialty in a trait for which the target already has
  Specialties, but cannot simply add dots to an existing Specialty.  Normally
  Lunar and Alchemical Exalted can only gain Specialties in Attributes, and
  other beings in Abilities, unless the being has somehow gained Specialties
  in some atypical kind of trait.  If the character or target knows any
  version of Idiosyncratic Interpretation of (Virtue), Specialty dots can be
  temporarily gained in any Virtue.

  TODO
  
  A roll of the character's (Lore + Essence) is compared against a difficulty
  of the target's Essence.  For willing targets, add dice equal to the
  target's own Essence.  If the character targets himself, the difficulty is
  reduced to one.
  
  Each success provides one point of temporary Ability increase for the
  target, which may be divided among up to (Essence) Abilities.  Any given
  Ability can be increased by at most one dot, and cannot be increased beyond
  the normal maximum for the target.  Extra successes beyond these limits are
  wasted.
  
  At Essence 4, the duration increases to (Essence) days per success on the
  roll, and the Charm gains the Training Keyword, meaning that, at the end of
  the Charm's duration, the target can spend experience to make some or all of
  the changes permanent, and may go into experience point debt to do so.
  However, this permanent training cannot raise an Ability beyond 4.  If the
  Shaping effect is undone or the Charm otherwise ends before experience is
  spent, this Training opportunity is lost.  At Essence 5 the duration
  increases to (Essence) weeks per success.
  
  *[TODO: Balance this against Numerology.]*

  *[Hmm ... this balances fine against Solar and Lunar training Charms, but
  seems odd set against Numerology.  How about the following ... Make it
  Reflexive, modifying a Numerology action which raises at least one Ability
  in one being for one week, for which the balance involves a reduction in the
  same trait for the character, over the same week.  Cost is 10m (no WP) but
  the character must also commit the Willpower spent on the Numerology action,
  plus the mote cost of any other Charms which modify that action.  The Charm
  targets a single affected being, which can spend the appropriate amount of
  experience immediately to treat that week as adequate training time, gaining
  access to the increased rating immediately.  If the character releases the
  mote commitment early, the experience is refunded and the training does not
  stick, though the Numerology effect continues to play out.  This training
  cannot raise traits beyond 4, and cannot raise a trait if the balance would
  take the character's Ability rating below zero.  The character cannot target
  himself with this Charm.  The Numerology effect may adjust more than one
  trait at once, but each activation of this Charm affects only one trait.
  The character can maintain up to (Essence) concurrent activations of this
  Charm, subject to available motes and Willpower, either on the same target
  or on multiple targets.  (Stackable.)]*

  A roll of the character's (Lore + Essence) is compared against a difficulty
  of the target's Essence.  For willing targets, add dice equal to the
  target's own Essence.  If the character targets himself, the difficulty is
  reduced to one.
  
  Each success provides one point of mutation which the character may inflict
  on the target.  However, the mutation takes its outward appearance from the
  target's own sense of self, so he or she may choose cosmetic details.
  Specifically, this automatically removes the benefit of the Solars'
  Destiny-Manifesting Method, though it will not overcome direct defenses like
  Integrity-Protecting Prana, except when used on a willing target.  The
  mutations unfold smoothly through the target's being in a matter of moments,
  in a disturbing yet painless and aesthetically pleasing ripple, taking
  effect at the start of the target's next action.
  
  At Essence 4, the duration increases to (Essence) days per success on the

  the Charm's duration, the target can spend experience to make some or all of

  the Shaping effect is undone or the Charm otherwise ends before experience
  is spent, this Training opportunity is lost.  At Essence 5 the duration
  increases to (Essence) weeks per success, and any Mutations taken on as
  Training have the potential to breed true.
  
  *[TODO: Allow Numerology to induce Mutations as well?]*

  *[Hmm ... as with other training Charms, let's rewrite this.  Have it be a
  Permanent Charm which makes Mutation points a valid trait for Numerology.
  If the target benefits, by addition of positive Mutations or removal of
  negative ones, then the balance can be that the target later suffers
  opposite Mutation changes, or that the character concurrently suffers them.
  Similarly, if the target is harmed, by removal of positive Mutations or
  addition of negative ones, the balance must involve later benefit for the
  target or concurrent harm to the character.  If the balance involves someone
  temporarily losing Mutation points, it is only a valid balance if that
  person already had pre-existing points to lose.  For the purpose of balance,
  the harm or benefit is counted purely in terms of Mutation points, even
  though some negative Mutations may work out positively in some situations
  and _vice versa_.]*

  TODO
  
  This Charm can be used to enhance any Training which a targeted being is
  undergoing, allows its effects to spread to others.  The target is regarded
  as being infected with a disease with a Virulence equal to the character's
  Essence, and Untreated and Treated Morbidity ratings of zero--the disease is
  never directly fatal, though it might lead the afflicted into dangerous
  actions.  The Difficulty to Treat is equal to the character's Essence if the
  healer has access to relevant magic, otherwise (Essence x 2).  Anyone immune
  to magical Sickness effects will find themselves sadly unable to benefit.

  Anyone who observes the trainee, or someone else already infected, at
  practice might find inspiration which counts as adequate tutelage.  In place
  of the usual (Stamina + Resistance) roll, those subsequently exposed resist
  using their (Conviction + Lore)--a mind too focused or full finds it hard to
  learn new things serendipitously.  Observers may spend a point of Willpower
  to suppress their Conviction and remove its dice from the resistance roll.
  Those who resist or are cured become immune until the disease has run its
  course.

  Those infected with this spirit of self-improvement can raise the same
  traits as the trainee, by the same number of dots, but cannot raise any
  further than the trainee herself.  The disease will last only as long as the
  original trainee's programme of study.  At that point the Charm ends, though
  any infected beings who have already begun to study may continue.  Note that
  this means that the Charm is not applicable to training which happens
  instantly, as may be the case with self-trained Exalts, for
  instance. Releasing the commitment of motes from this Charm early ends the
  effects of the disease immediately for all beyond the original trainee, and
  their learning will fail, with a refund of any experience spent.  The
  Magnitude of beings that can be infected concurrently is equal to the
  character's (Essence + 1).  The character can maintain at most (Essence)
  simultaneous activations of this Charm, and any one being can be infected
  from at most one trainee.  This generally means that those infected can be
  training only one trait, unless the trainee is subject to some Storyteller
  exemption or other magic which allows him to train more than one trait at
  once.

  Applied to a member of a mass combat unit, this Charm ensures that all
  members will receive the training benefits, provided they seclude themselves
  from contact with outsiders for the training time.  In combination with
  <<Lore_rtc>>, this Charm allows training of the Drill and--by raising
  average Valor--Might of a unit.

  Once activated, this Charm reduces the effect on the character's anima of
  her spending Essence from her Peripheral pool.  The total number of motes
  spent in each action period is divided by two, rounded down, to a minimum of
  one, to determine its contribution to the level of Divisional mark and anima
  visibility.  Obvious Charms remain so.  This does not increase the effective
  size of her mote pool.
  
  If the Chaos Child currently has motes and Willpower committed to make her
  appear as a mortal with no mote pool, using the ability innate to all
  Discordians, then this Charm itself does not contribute to anima visibility
  at all, and its duration increases to Indefinite.  In that case, when this
  Charm ends, the character's Divisional mark and anima immediately show at a
  level matching her currently level of expenditure from her Peripheral pool.
  This may result in a totemic-level flare, even though she is not at that
  moment spending Essence.

  This Charm transfers up to (Lore + Essence) motes between the character and
  the target, in either direction.  If the target has multiple Essence pools,
  such as the Personal and Peripheral pools of the Exalted, it chooses how
  many motes are drawn from or added to each pool.  Beings without an Essence
  pool are not valid targets for this Charm.
  
  If the target is unwilling, the character must make a successful attack roll
  to touch it, and the two make a contested (Essence + Lore) roll.  If the
  Erisian wins, the transfer is in the desired direction, and he gains a point
  of Podge.  If he fails, the direction is reversed, and he gains a point of
  Hodge.  In the case of a tie, nothing happens, but the motes are spent.
  Used on a willing target, there is no contested roll and no gain of Hodge or
  Podge.
  
  In any case, this Charm cannot reduce either being's mote pool below zero,
  nor increase it beyond its maximum.

  This Charm supplements a Numerology action, allowing an Erisian to spend
  three motes to regard herself as belonging to a different Division, for the

  an Unbending Arm would normally pay one Numerology point to influence the soak
  of a physical object, but three for living beings, since that number is
