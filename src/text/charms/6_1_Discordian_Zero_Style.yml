  Style based on balance of power.  Celestial level, pushing the boundaries
  towards Sidereal.  Counterattacks, flurry-breakers, dual Knockback(?),
  mimicing opponent.

  Should be a full fighting style, 7-8 Charms.

  RWG says: look at 2.5 version of Solar Hero, Violet Bier of Sorrows and
  Infernal Monster.  Enhanced effects probably shouldn't be as powerful, but
  straight powers can be, because they're open to all CMA users.

  * Instant-on Form condition: if attacked when not wearing armor or wielding
  a weapon?

  * On Join Battle, match best roll across all opponents (but excluding
  allies).  Character does not roll, so cannot get better than opponents.

  * Attack as if wielding the same weapon as any one opponent.  Doesn't gain
  unique artifact powers, but does include magical material bonuses?  RWG
  points out you'd have to be careful that the character didn't gain bonuses
  without also gaining penalties that the opponent had, e.g., from mote
  commitments, weapon drawbacks etc.

  * Soak as if wearing the same armor as any one opponent.  Doesn't gain
  unique artifact powers, but does include magical material bonuses?  Same
  caveats as with weapons.

  * Add to soak based on further non-weapon bonuses which one opponent has.
  Maybe only add, say, half the difference?

  * Automatic Counterattack; action-long or scene-long -- but I have quite a
  few already.

  * Using weapon and armor stats in unusual ways, e.g., using Damage of
  improvised weapon as extra soak, with the weapon maybe being destroyed; or
  attacking with armor.

  Native non-Style MA follow-on Charms which add things like use of Elsewhere
  to bypass armor, or to give a perfect dodge which applies only to
  non-area-effect attacks, by making an Elsewhere ``hole'' through the
  character.

  Every journey begins with a first step, be the ground mud, grass or
  brass.  The martial artist acknowledges her mortal passions, and begins to see
  that the focus of the form comes not from repressing them, but from mastering
  them knack of opening them up to inspiration from higher powers.
  
  If the character channels a Virtue on a stunted Martial Arts action which is
  successful, she may role the same number of Virtue dice again, with each
  success adding one points of Essence to the reward from the stunt.
  Alternatively she may regain half that many points of Willpower, rounded up.
  In addition, the character regains one channel of any one Virtue at the end of
  the scene.  She cannot regain more than one Virtue channel through use of this
  Charm, regardless of how many times she uses it in a scene.
