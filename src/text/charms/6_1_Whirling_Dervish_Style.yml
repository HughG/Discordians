name: Whirling Dervish Style
trait: Martial Arts
text: |

  The term ``whirling dervish'' is used casually in the South to refer to any
  holy man or woman who makes rapid and reptitive rotation or other movement
  part of their routine of prayer and meditation.  Mostly these are simply
  ways of distracting the mind from quotidian matters.  Some evolve into
  structured and stylized systems of movement which are treated as prayer in
  themselves.  A few--most often wandering mendicants who need to be able to
  protect themselves--have taken this practice further, evolving it into a
  martial art, and from their mortal attempts this Celestial style has
  evolved.

  A few Dragon-Blooded have been known to practise it and, rumor has it, at
  least one of the newly-returned Solar Exalted, but nobody can reliably trace
  its lineage back to its first master.  It has been seen occasionally across
  the South, but is most popular near An-Teng, where a more relaxed attitude
  to worship of Terrestrial gods helps its practitioners avoid trouble with
  Immaculate monks.  Strictly speaking, there is nothing heretical in this
  style, but it has lead more than one Dragon-Blooded devotee to form a
  particularly close relationship--in terms of work, prayer, and possibly
  more--with a single god, in defiance of the Realm's official calendar of
  worship, and attitude to Terrestrial gods in general.
  
  The form weapons of this style are whips, fighting chains, ropes, sashes,
  and artifact equivalents such as the Dire Chain and Essence Lash.  Most of
  the Charms can also be used with unarmed attacks.  The style can be
  practised in light armor, but nothing more substantial.

  Although none are known to have bothered to learn it so far, this style
  could be particularly useful to gods.

  Few take up the challenge of using this style's form weapons because, as
  they soon discover (<<SotM>>, p. 156), chain and rope weapons need at least
  five feet of free space around them to be swung effectively.  Through long
  practise of the apparently-random movements of this style, however, a
  Dervish can avoid this restriction.  This Charm allows the character to use
  the style's form weapons without needing any extra free space around him as
  compared to shorter martial arts weapons.

  The mystic whirls and spins to distance himself from the distractions of the
  physical world, to lead him towards a higher awareness. His motion also has
  a practical side-effect, confusing his opponents and making him harder to
  hit.  This Charm adds his Martial Arts rating to his Dodge DV.  If he
  successfully dodges an attack, this Charm costs a cumulative 1m less to
  activate on his next action, to a minimum of 1 on the 3rd and subsequent
  successful consecutive dodge. If he is not attacked on his next action, or
  does not activate it, or fails to dodge the attack, then this discount is
  lost and the Charm's cost returns to the full 3m the next time it is
  activated.  This Charm cannot be activated if the character is restrained
  from moving.

  The wild whirling of the Dervish is both a shield to himself, and a threat
  to his enemies, or anyone who gets too close.

  This Charm supplements an attack made while the character spins.  Any
  successful hit causes the target to check for Knockdown, and the target in
  fact suffers Knockback if she fails the check.  Although an attempt to knock
  down an opponent by sweeping with a chain or similar weapon normally suffers
  a -2 penalty (<<Exalted>>, p.153), an attack supplemented with this Charm
  does not.  This Charm cannot be activated if the character is restrained
  from moving.

  Hands sweeping through the air in complex patterns of near-prayer, the wise
  Dervish meditates on the notion that all beings are one, and all conflict
  folly.  Therefore, he seeks to end it swiftly, by relieving his opponent of
  his means of attack.
  
  This Charm gives the character's weapon or unarmed attack the D (disarming)
  tag if it did not already have it, giving it a +2 Accuracy bonus for the
  disarming attempt.  Furthermore, the character adds his (Martial Arts รท 2)
  in automatic successes.  If he manages to disarm his opponent, he cannot
  hold or break the weapon but throws it three yards for every success on the
  attack.

  As his dizzy speed blurs his outline in the eyes of his opponents, so this
  Charm blurs the line between the material and immaterial, as the Dervish
  catches a glimpse of the spirit world.  He is able to see, hear, and target
  any immaterial being who is joined in battle with him as friend or foe, to
  whom he has prayed in the last week, or to whom he has an Intimacy.

  Mastering the Form of this Style, the Dervish's spiritual and physical
  motive frequencies begin to resonate, granting him a supernatural grace,
  even when he appears at rest, and an unwavering connection to the spirit
  world.

  In the physical realm, this Form allows the character to Dash and to Rise
  from Prone with Speed 3 and a DV penalty of -0.  As an exception to the
  normal Combo rules, he can activate <<Whirling_Dervish_Style_vrp>> together
  with this Form-type Charm.

  He is able to see and hear--but not physically target--those immaterial
  beings described in <<Whirling_Dervish_Style_vrm>>.  The cost of activating
  that Charm drops to 3m and, again as an exception to the normal Combo rules,
  it may be activated in combination with this Charm.

  Lastly, his semi-meditative spinning becomes a form of subliminal prayer,
  enhancing his connection with any allies who are valid recipients for
  such--typically spirits, demons, and beings with the Cult Background.  He or
  any such ally can take a Coordinate Attack action, which must involve him,
  with a reduced Speed of 3.  Organizing the attack is done with a roll of
  ([Dexterity or Charisma] + [Martial Arts or War]).

  As his constant gyrations carry him further into the spiritual realm, the
  Dervish's physical movements surpasses mortal means and eye, carrying him
  careening between foes on an unpredictable and unstoppable path.
  
  This Charm provides a magical flurry of Martial Arts actions.  The character
  rolls (Martial Arts + Essence)--without use of Excellences or similar
  Charms--and gains one action per success, plus one action.  The attacks
  ignore weapon Rate and can be against a single target, or against separate
  targets.  The character may Move reflexively before each attack and after
  the last.  The DV penalty for the flurry is equal to the highest penalty for
  any one of the attacks.

  The Dervish's whirling seems manic and random to those who are untutored,
  but in fact the footsteps and arm gestures are improvised from a detailed
  language of religious expression.  With sufficient experience, this fluid
  precision can be applied in combat also.  This Charm applies magical
  manipulation of the style's form weapons to allow the character to grapple
  at a distance of up to 10 yards.  There are two consequences of this
  extended range.

  The first is that, once an opponent is retrained at a distance using this
  Charm, gaining control of the clinch does not allow them to grapple the
  character unless they can close the distance with a Move action.  Instead
  they get an opportunity to disarm the character, with an external penalty of
  -1 rather than the usual -2.  As usual, disarming is not possible if the
  character's weapons are natural or strapped to his body.  If the character
  chooses to close the distance voluntarily, or is forced to do so by
  circumstances, this benefit is lost.

  The second side-effect is due to the leverage provided by the extra length
  of the weapon, and the momentum from the character's spinning.  If a
  grappled opponent is immediately and successfully thrown, the distance is
  multiplied by the character's Essence and, even though this inflicts no
  damage, the target must check for Stunning at a difficulty equal to the
  character's ([Essence + Martial Arts] รท 2).  If used in a Combo with a Charm
  carrying the Knockdown keyword, the distance is further multiplied by the
  character's Martial Arts rating.  The stunning inflicted by this throw is a
  Crippling effect.

  This Charm cannot be used if the character is not wielding a form weapon.

  Becoming more familiar with the spirit world, the Dervish learns that it has
  its own strife just as the physical does.  Some might despair at this but,
  by accepting it, he is able to drawn upon the experience and aid of its
  inhabitants.

  This Charm targets an ally of the character who is Joined in Battle with
  him--most likely a spirit to whom he offers worship.  As long as it remains
  active, that character can activate any Charms which allow him or her to
  materialize or dematerialize, without paying any Essence towards them, as a
  miscellaneous action with Speed 6.

  At the pinnacle of this Style, the Dervish finally achieves union with the
  world his motion worships, bridging the gap between the physical and
  spiritual realms.  Upon activating this Charm, for a number of actions equal
  to his Essence rating, he is able to become either material or immaterial
  whenever he takes a Move or Dash action.  On the tick on which he would take
  his next action after this Charm, he returns to the state he had before it
  was activated.
