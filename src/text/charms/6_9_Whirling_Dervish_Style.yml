  The mystic whirls and spins to distance himself from the distractions of the
  physical world, to lead him towards a higher awareness. His motion also has
  a practical side-effect, confusing his opponents and making him harder to
  hit.  This Charm adds his Martial Arts rating to his Dodge DV.  If he
  successfully dodges an attack, this Charm costs a cumulative 1m less to
  activate on his next action, to a minimum of 1 on the 3rd and subsequent
  successful consecutive dodge. If he is not attacked on his next action, or
  does not activate it, or fails to dodge the attack, then this discount is
  lost and the Charm's cost returns to the full 3m the next time it is
  activated.  This Charm cannot be activated if the character is restrained
  from moving.

  The wild whirling of the XXX is both a shield to himself, and a threat to
  his enemies, or anyone who gets too close.

  This Charm supplements an attack made while the character spins.  Any
  successful hit causes the target to check for Knockdown, and the target in
  fact suffers Knockback if she fails the check.  Although an attempt to knock
  down an opponent by sweeping with a chain or similar weapon normally suffers
  a -2 penalty (<<Exalted>>, p.153), an attack supplemented with this Charm
  does not.  This Charm cannot be activated if the character is restrained
  from moving.

  Hands sweeping through the air in complex patterns of near-prayer, the wise
  XXX meditates on the notion that all beings are one, and all conflict
  folly.  Therefore, he seeks to end it swiftly, by relieving his opponent of
  his means of attack.
  
  This Charm gives the character's weapon or unarmed attack the D (disarming)
  tag if it did not already have it, giving it a +2 Accuracy bonus for the
  disarming attempt.  Furthermore, the character adds his (Martial Arts รท 2)
  in automatic successes.  If he manages to disarm his opponent, he cannot
  hold or break the weapon but throws it three yards for every success on the
  attack.

  As his dizzy speed blurs his outline in the eyes of his opponents, so this
  Charm blurs the line between the material and immaterial, as the XXX catches
  a glimpse of the spirit world.  He is able to see, hear, and target any
  immaterial being who is joined in battle with him as friend or foe, to whom
  he has prayed in the last week, or to whom he has an Intimacy.

  Mastering the Form of this Style, the XXX's spiritual and physical motive
  frequencies begin to resonate, granting him a supernatural grace, even when
  he appears at rest, and an unwavering connection to the spirit world.

  In the physical realm, this Form allows the character to Dash and to Rise
  from Prone with Speed 3 and a DV penalty of -0.

  He is able to see and hear--but not physically target--those immaterial
  beings described in <<Whirling_Dervish_Style_vrm>>.  The cost of activating
  that Charm drops to 3m and, as an exception to the normal Combo rules, it
  may be activated in combination with this Charm.

  Lastly, his semi-meditative spinning becomes a form of subliminal prayer,
  enhancing his connection with any allies who are valid recipients for
  such--typically spirits, demons, and beings with the Cult Background.  He or
  any such ally can take a Coordinate Attack action, which must involve him,
  with a reduced Speed of 3.  Organizing the attack is done with a roll of
  ([Dexterity or Charisma] + [Martial Arts or War]).

  The XXX's whirling seems manic and random to those who are untutored, but in
  fact the footsteps and arm gestures are improvised from a detailed language
  of religious expression.  With sufficient experience, this fluid precision
  can be applied in combat also.  This Charm applies magical manipulation of
  the style's form weapons to allow the character to grapple at a distance of
  up to 10 yards.  There are two consequences of this extended range.

  The first is that, once an opponent is retrained at a distance using this
  Charm, gaining control of the clinch does not allow them to grapple the
  character unless they can close the distance with a Move action.  Instead
  they get an opportunity to disarm the character, with an external penalty of
  -1 rather than the usual -2.  As usual, disarming is not possible if the
  character's weapons are natural or strapped to his body.  If the character
  chooses to close the distance voluntarily, or is forced to do so by
  circumstances, this benefit is lost.

  The second side-effect is due to the leverage provided by the extra length
  of the weapon, and the momentum from the character's spinning.  If a
  grappled opponent is immediately and successfully thrown, the distance is
  multiplied by the character's Essence and, even though this inflicts no
  damage, the target must check for Stunning at a difficulty equal to the
  character's ([Essence + Martial Arts] รท 2).  If used in a Combo with a Charm
  carrying the Knockdown keyword, the distance is further multiplied by the
  character's Martial Arts rating.  The stunning inflicted by this throw is a
  Crippling effect.

  This Charm cannot be used if the character is not wielding a form weapon.


- 5/3 Materialize ally.  Indefinite; Stackable; allows one ally who would normally be immaterial to materialize or dematerialize at no cost, as a miscellaneous action.  If character is prevented from moving, the Charm ends.  When the Charm ends, the target reverts to its previous state.


- 4/3 Whirling shield. Tick long? Perfect? Not if currently grappling? Reduce Accuracy to increase DV?

[Fluff]

This Charm provides a magical flurry of (Essence) Martial Arts actions.  [Check errata re Rate.]  The attacks can be against a single target, or against separate targets provided all are in range without the character having to move further than her Move distance.  The DV penalty for the flurry is equal to the highest penalty for any one of the attacks.

- 5/4 Travelling Without Moving. Attack, and parry ranged, at N * weapon Reach, without moving. Also Defend Other? Unexpected? 1m to recall disarmed weapons? Shield even if grappling?  Hmm, or, make the character temporarily immaterial?
