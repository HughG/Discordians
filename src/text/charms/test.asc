later headings down a level from where AsciiDoc "corrects" them to (which

=== Multi-Line Section Level 1 Heading

Here's some text for this section.  It's just here to check line spacing in
wrapped section titles and before the following body text paragraph.

==== Multi-Line Section Level 2 Heading

Here's some text for this section.  It's just here to check line spacing in
wrapped section titles and before the following body text paragraph.

===== Multi-Line Section Level 3 Heading, Which Needs to Be Longer to Wrap

Here's some text for this section.  It's just here to check line spacing in
wrapped section titles and before the following body text paragraph.

TODO 2012-04-02 HUGR: I need to customise the bibliography titlepage to get
the headings to be left-aligned.  It's not enough to customise
bibliography.titlepage.recto.style, because that gets overridden at the
component.title level; and it's too much to override
component.title.properties, because that applies to chapter titles as well.

I customised the bibliography list to use definition lists, so that I can have a descriptive para for each one.

Most find comfort behind the ordered walls of civilisation, but the
Daughter of Eris smiles and laughs among the chaos of the wildest places.
This Charm supplements a roll to resist environmental damage.  It allows the
character to add (Survival ÷ 2) successes to the (Stamina + Resistance) roll,
and increases the magnitude of the time period until the next check (where the
orders of magnitude are: action, minute, hour, day).

Strange snakes are proverbially said to lie with their forked tongues.
Exalts, being human, generally have legs, and Discordians choose at times to
lie with their feet.  (This differs from Lunar Exalted who are, of course,
more likely just to lie with a snake.)

This Charm supplements a roll to evade pursuit, laying false trails and making
the tracks of the Whistling Voice lead into those of other creatures.  It
allows the character to add (Essence ÷ 2) successes when contesting his (Wits
+ Survival) against a pursuer's (Perception + Survival).  If the pursuer is
sucessfully shaken off, he or she will not simply find a trail gone cold, but
will be led to some other local creature, which may or may not be hostile.

Lawgivers with this Charm are known for their moments of brilliance. *The
Exalt's player can invoke this Charm when making a roll based on the relevant
Ability. This Charm then adds one die to that roll for each mote spent.* This
Charm is the paradigmatic dice adder. The rule that Solars are prohibited from
increasing a dice pool by more than their (Attribute + Ability) almost always
refers to the purchase of dice through the use of this Charm.

The balance between order and chaos is closely linked to the balance
between predator and prey, nourishment and destruction.  Thus the nature of
the Ignorant Children appeals to ignorant beasts.

This Charm supplements a roll to find animals, for food or any other purpose,
not by increasing the hunter's skill but by drawing animals (or other local
creatures of equivalent intelligence and power) to him.  It allows the
character to add ([the higher of Charisma or Appearance] ÷ 2) successes to the
(Intelligence + Survival) roll for hunting.  If the hunt is successful, the
hunter will find that a number of other animals, equal in Magnitude to
(Essence ÷ 2), have also been drawn in, though they will be of various
indigenous types, not necessarily the kind hunted.  The character may thus
acquire additional food, or may have to fight local creatures to keep his
prize.

The Most Beautiful do not deign to have their fair skin lashed by
sandstorms, or a lock brushed out of place in an avalanche.  This Charm allows
the character to ignore all damage to themselves and their equipment from any
one type of environmental damage for one scene.  The environmental effect must
be one which would normally have harmed the character, for this Charm to
apply.  This Charm is not applicable to poisons unless they are a pervasive
part of the environment, e.g., toxic gases around a volcano.

Any number of times during the Charm's duration, he may pay a further 2 motes
and concentrate for a Miscellaneous Action, to heal a single health level by
treating the effect as an additional Erisian element.  This does not count as
a Charm use.  As with the Resistance Charm known as Erisian Elemental
Rejuvenation, the character is Inactive during that action.  He may return to
normal reflexively at any time during that action, e.g., for reflexive
self-defense, but that will disrupt concentration and lose the healing
benefits.  The motes will still be spent in this case.  Also, this power
diverts all healing energy to the Exalt alone, so any mundane equipment they
carry may be damaged during that action.

Those who are a Law Unto Themselves do not have quite the primitive,
brutal sympathy with other beings which the Lunar Exalted carry in their
blood, but they can fake it for a while.

With this Charm the character may take on the appearance of any creature of
animal-level intelligence, native to the surrounding environment.  The
character does not gain any physical abilities or traits of the creature so
mimicked, but will be accepted as what he appears to be by any normal denizen
of that habitat.  Resisting this unnatural mental influence normally requires
spending 3 points of willpower.  Those with magical nature or powers which
give them reason to suspect it (e.g., Lunars, those able to see Essence flows
etc.) may resist by spending a single point of willpower.  If anyone
successfully resists, the character gains a point of Hodge (at most one per
scene).  Use of any Obvious Charms, or exhibiting any abilities or behaviors
which are inappropriate to the animal, automatically ends the illusion,
regardless of the presence or absence of witnesses.

The character may shift form once per scene, for an additional expenditure
(not committment) of 2 motes of Essence.  This requires a Miscellaneous Action
but does not count as Charm use.

===== The Earth is My Sheepdog
[role="noindent"]
indexterm:[Charms, Survival, The Earth is My Sheepdog]*Cost:* 4m + 1wp; *Mins:* Survival 3, Ess 3; *Type:* Supplemental +
*Keywords:* Combo-OK, Shaping +
*Duration:* One scene +
*Prerequisite Charms:* Animal Magnetism +

Where others search intently for those they wish to track, the
Discordian Exalt harnesses the twin powers of confusion and laziness, to cause
her very surroundings to bring the quarry to her.

This Charm supplements an attempt to pursue some target, temporarily applying
subtle Shaping to the environment around said target, to confuse them and herd
them towards the Lawbreaker.  This imposes an external penalty equal to the
character's Essence on attempts at evasion by the subject of pursuit.  The
alterations to the environment make the path of pursuit more obvious in
general, giving a bonus +2 dice to any others attempting to follow the same
quarry (or, indeed, the character) for the next day.  The terrain over which
pursuit occurs need not actually be earth: even in the Deep Wyld, this Charm
makes bizarre but effective changes to the target's surroundings.

A being is a valid target for this Charm if the character can see (or
otherwise sense) them directly, or has a trail to begin with, which is
sufficient to allow a roll to track them.  Effects which prevent Shaping from
affecting the target directly make no difference to this Charm, since it
applies to the environment around the target.  Effects which counter Shaping
in an area around the target reduce the penalties and bonuses of this Charm by
an amount equal to the difference in Essence between the character and the
source of the effect, to a minimum of zero.

[TODO: Does the Duration make sense here?  I was thinking of "a scene" as
covering several rolls in an extended series, but I'm not sure that's how
other STs would see it.  Maybe I can say that explicitly?  Or make it be
"(Essence) Dramatic Actions" or something?]
